# Design Notes
This master’s thesis content is designed firstly as a website, using _web-to-print_ features in an endeavor to experiment with the concept of _single-source publishing_, i.e. a method to manage content only in one source, reducing the potential for error, keeping the editing in one place, and using web technologies to shape content a plurality of media. With accessibility in mind, the web-based content allows a richer approach, including all senses using video or website embeds, audio recording from the conducted interviews and textual transcripts counterparts, as well as the textual and visual content of the overall thesis. 

Through this process also was considered a personal experiment with the tinkering of alternative publishing and writing tools, rather than standard corporated counterparts. Having a background initially anchored in printed graphic design, my current professional endgoal is to embrace coding as tool for design, and evolve towards a hybrid model of design and computation. Another goal being to also support libre, open-source, and community-driven alternatives, such as collaborative pads for writing, and the paged.js library. While the pads revealed unsuccessful in collaborating with my tutors and proofreaders, the latter library proved to be a valuable resource to integrate in my designer’s publishing toolkit. Using web technologies such as the semantic markup of HTML and visual styling CSS, paged.js helped me to achieve the production in this case of both the website and its printed document in multiple formats. 

For a master thesis investigating the Web and some of its platforms, users and their use-cases, it only made sense to start from there, and to then make it accessible as best I could, considering how unfortunately sometimes, academic writings either in PDF documents, printed, or through academic web platforms can lack a broader audience through limited online presence, restricted open-access, and lack of indexation in search results. The design of this web thesis started from serendipity, while casually searching through GitHub public repositories for web-to-print resources. This led me to find by surprise a template released just a few days prior, PageTypeToPrint. Created by Julien Bidoret for ESAD Pyrénées School of Art & Design Master Thesis writings, I truly want to thank him for bringing this open-source tool online. This gave me a headstart in the coding architecture, only leaving room to customize design and functionalities to my thesis needs within my limited coding skills, which hopefully has improved since the beginning of this multimedia adventure.
