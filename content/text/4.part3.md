# Are<span class="arena">.na</span>, what type of&nbsp;digital&nbsp;garden?

#### Defined as an “enclosed area for public entertainment,” the term “Arena”[^arenadef] not only denotes physical space but also symbolizes a “sphere of interest, activity, or debate”. Within the domain of UGC platforms, data often resides in secluded silos, restricted behind access barriers. Exploring the distinctive realm of collaborative knowledge creation, this chapter unveils the profound impact and intricate design of <span class="arena">Are.na</span>—a platform reshaping the landscape of creative processes and information sharing–considered by many as a digital community garden[^digcomgarden]. While featuring use cases from the interviewees, it is pertinent to acknowledge that I am an active participant and advocate of this platform.

## <span class="arena">Are.na</span>: an indie social network for&nbsp;creatives 

<span class="arena">Are.na</span> is a niche independent online social network and creative research platform brought by artists, for artists, featuring niche high-quality curated content, founded in 2014 by artists and designers Charles Broskoski and Daniel Pianetti, among others. Private and free to use (for limited use and functionalities), it is solely financially sustained by its paying members. <span class="arena">Are.na</span> stands out from the current market of UGC platforms by offering an ad-free environment, without recommender algorithms and user data collection, allowing its members to exit algorithmic feeds. <span class="arena">Are.na</span> states on their website: “We are the only social media company whose only customers are the people who use it.”[^indie]

[^indie]: About, Are.na [online] [https://www.Are.na/about](https://www.Are.na/about) [consulted: 2023.11.25]

Described on its landing page as a “more mindful place […] to structure your ideas and build new forms of knowledge together”[^aboutarena], and by its members as a “Social media that doesn't damage your brain”, a “Pinterest for nerds” or “A garden of ideas”,[^describearena], the platform essentially involves in collection-making and curation for creatives, building knowledge individually and/or collectively.

(figure: content/images/describearena.png caption: Are.na Open Channel: _How do you describe Are.na at a party?_)

Instead of being an all-in-one tool that doesn’t do anything well, <span class="arena">Are.na</span> relies on a few key introverted features: connecting **blocks** (images, URLs, texts, pdfs, etc.) and **channels** (gathering containers) into other channels–either by uploading, web-clipping (via browser extension), or linking other users’ content. 

Channels can either be private, closed (publicly visible, restricted edit) or open (contributable). Asking for a slightly more cognitive load by design, <span class="arena">Are.na</span> emphasizes better contextualization of the content, while omitting extraverted typical social features such as "likes," "favorites," or "shares", to encourage active use of the platform.

Radically distinctive by its withdrawn minimalist monochromatic design and its default Arial typography, the interface features a calm and distraction-free environment, favoring content over form. 

Main pages such as _Explore (grid-view) _and_ Feed (stack-view)_ feature chronologically ordered blocks pooled from either all users or the ones you follow. The _Profile_ and channel pages list content in modular views to choose from (channel rows, blocks only, channels only, table, index).

A detailed view of a block showcases all the channels it is branched in, along with metadata (source, connected by and date) and secondary features to comment on. The minimal UI is exhaustively puzzled out as a _mise en abyme_ by David Reinfurt in an open channel _a-r-e-n-a_.[^reinfurt] According to Daniel, simplicity and reliability are what makes <span class="arena">Are.na</span> distinctive:

> You know why I like to use Are.na? Because you can take a hundred images and drag them up on the screen. And it works. You need tools that are stupid simple in the sense that they're incredibly reliable.

Reminiscent of hypertext _Project Xanadu_ (1960)(imagenote: content/images/xanadu.jpg caption: Project Xanadu, Ted Nelson, 1960.), serendipity and networked thoughts are enhanced thanks to the **bi-directional linking** of blocks & channels. The information architecture is rendered as a **folder structure**, yet underneath the hood, it works rather as a **nodal view**. Whether you go single-player or collaborative, blocks and channels are fully interconnected to other members' channels, proposing a glimpse into the brains of other creatives.

**Open Source** by default while remaining private, <span class="arena">Are.na</span> allows its members to export their data as flat text or image files, and also .csv, .html or .pdf files (or .json through the API), and therefore exit its enclosed silo. Copyright-wise, the platform offers source search features, as well as the possibility to credit wherever possible original sources to further contextualize the content curated by its members. In addition, the platform released a free **API**[^api], allowing the creation of custom tools, such as _Hyperchannel_[^hyperchannel], 3D graph channel visualizer, <span class="arena">Are.na</span>-to-Print[^printarena], <span class="arena">Are.na</span>-to-Slides[^slidearena], etc.

Metrics set the platform as quite a niche compared to bigger mainstream platforms. Currently composed of 27391 monthly active members, 13617 of them are paying members, and the platform generates 1.21 million monthly connections. Its self-sustainability model currently generates a monthly revenue of $80841, allowing for the maintenance costs, and remuneration of the small team in charge of full-time and part-time positions in engineering, product and operations, editorial events, and merchandising. This smaller scale factor allows its dedicated members to sense better ownership (through feedback channels, community events, and publications).

## Use cases from interviews 

Being an open-ended platform, <span class="arena">Are.na</span> does not restrict specific uses to its members. A channel from the _Are.na Commons_ proposes members to add in their use cases. [^howtoarena] The open-endedness of a tool allows for more exploratory and intuitive approaches such as Aurélie’s use of <span class="arena">Are.na</span>:

[^howtoarena]: Are.na COMMONS, 2023, How do you use Are.na?, Are.na (Open Channel) [online] [https://www.Are.na/Are.na-commons/how-do-you-use-Are.na](https://www.Are.na/Are.na-commons/how-do-you-use-Are.na) [consulted: 2023.11.25]

> It's pretty hard to know what the real purpose of the people who created these platforms is, I've never looked. There must be instructions for use, I don't know. I've never thought about it. I just intuitively did what was most useful for me. 
> <span>–Aurélie Vial</span>

The interviews drew a diverse range of use cases about interviewees’ gathering methods and creative research purposes. Florian creates private channels to stimulate the birth of a project while creating public channels on the side for more general mood boards.[^FlorianMood] Most of Baker’s and Gemma's are open channels, encouraging other members to contribute elements. Aurélie creates private collaborative channels teamwork mood boards which she can then share with her clients, stating: “I don't just take blocks, part of what I add is images I've taken from sites, from Google, from Pinterest. But I also, scan things from books or other sources and add them to Are.na.” Jonas uses a lot the browser extension to web-clip content into <span class="arena">Are.na</span> “relevant to one of [his] ongoing research channels […] with only two clicks.” As Baker puts it in a broader perspective:

[^FlorianMood]: HILT, Florian, 2023, Moodboard, Are.na (Public Channel) [online] [https://www.Are.na/florian-hilt/moodboard-57offqyw3oi](https://www.Are.na/florian-hilt/moodboard-57offqyw3oi) [consulted: 2023.11.25]

<br class="breakpage">

> I wouldn't say that I hack Are.na, but I would say that I have a fairly conventional use of a tool that's relatively unconventional in the sense that the first time you show it to people, they are like "What's this thing?" 

Advanced use cases, such as the use of <span class="arena">Are.na</span> API was discussed. Baker uses a script to store quotes from his Kindle readings in a channel.[^bakerkindle] Gemma publicly showcases her research channels as portfolio value on her website[^gemmaweb], while also using <span class="arena">Are.na</span> as hosting for her website media, stating:

> There's a whole arena channel of people using Are.na for websites. I do feel a bit sneaky sometimes because I also use it to post all the images on my site and therefore not pay for my own hosting. Thank you. I'm just using your service.

Jonas created an online web design gallery connected to one of his channels.[^collected] As Jonas says: “I was collecting inspiring website designs for myself for two years already when I started playing around with the API and built this site. What was originally intended as a fun little experiment has now turned into quite a popular design showcase.” Similarly, Baker Wardlaw and the teaching staff of a visual arts course for architecture students at EPFL (Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne) created an <span class="arena">Are.na</span> group[^Artsfundaments] for the course gathering of references, publishing students projects, and communication of the course through a website.[^EPFL]

## Open-endedness Versus Limits of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Platform Impacting Creativity

From those interviews, three profiles were drawn: from fully private profiles to mixed feelings between sharing and gatekeeping specific channels, and to fully displaying publicly or allowing contribution to the channels. 

They helped me draw out a tension point on originality and singularity of research compromised by a personal curation process within uniformized collective gatherings of inputs, or social bubbles. 

Depending on who you follow and how many, Frederik draws parallels between <span class="arena">Are.na</span> and more mainstream social media feeds: “<span class="arena">Are.na</span> is also sometimes the same phenomenon as Instagram, it can be a bit "death scrolling" when you follow too many people. It starts to snowball, and then you lose track a bit.”

Passively scrolling through the content on <span class="arena">Are.na</span> without really looking at it, can indeed prevent its members from contextualizing what is shown before them as in any other platforms. According to Daniel, “What you need, it's not information but the patience to look through them, and not many people have that.”

As Charles Broskoski stated in his 2019 conference, “The more you use <span class="arena">Are.na</span> the more you get out of it.” [^platformattr2] But until when can this become overwhelming or too much?

Frequency of use is one identified tension point drawn from interviews, leading to both benefits of enhanced access to references and gathering, yet inconveniences of death-scrolling expressed by Frederik or Aurélie, or social bubbles of homogenized references according to him and Émilie.

[^platformattr2]: BROSKOSKI, Charles, 2019. _Creating the new social web, _The Conference [online]. Malmö, Sweden. 28 August 2019. Retrieved from :[ https://videos.theconference.se/charles-broskoski-creating-the](https://videos.theconference.se/charles-broskoski-creating-the) [consulted: 2023.11.25]. 

Frederik argues: “The people I follow on <span class="arena">Are.na</span>, apart from certain artists, etc., are a lot of people who do the same thing as me. So you end up in a spiral where you also see their references and make them your own.” This echoes Émilie’s _single-player_ use of <span class="arena">Are.na</span>: “I'm going to try to find things more organically because I have the impression that on these platforms, there are a lot of people reposting, and as time goes by, the content becomes very polished and you can't find anything out of the ordinary.” When looking outside of <span class="arena">Are.na</span>, in other platforms such as Pinterest, Aurélie implies: “you feel that it's a mass thing, and then the images, they come back all the time.” 

While Frederik remains partly open to sharing on a restrictive basis, he likes for some “to keep them public. I have this channel of Swiss logos[^swisslogos] that I find quite funny, it's even open to contribute”. Other private channels where he states the need to review first before showcasing and prioritizing in-real-life modes of sharing. 

For Daniel, which tests the quantitative success of a curated channel by waiting to gather sufficient content before it becomes a thing ready to publish: “If that river goes nowhere, it just dissolves. So then what I do with these things is keep them private.” For Jonas, his channels are rarely open for contribution and his “more general research (like inspiring graphic design or useful development resources) is public from the start. Project-specific research often starts private and is sometimes published later.” He also had similar concerns to Frederik, about the potential lack of context in the sharing of project-specific research.

(figure: content/images/fma-swiss.png caption: Frederik Mahler-Andersen's open channel gathering logos intertwined with Swiss Cross)

The collaboration and contribution to channels are quite disparate from the results of the interviews. Baker and Gemma, on the other hand, are fervent members of the “Go Green” open channels, embracing contribution and the social network aspects of <span class="arena">Are.na</span>.

<br class="breakpage">

> Having the channels open, was a decision I made a few years ago, in this idea of not trying to gatekeep or say "these things are my own" because, at the end of the day, it's a collection of other people's things. So why should I be "Oh, this is mine as the curator."
> <span>–Gemma Copeland</span>

In her gathering process, Gemma states green channels as means of honesty in her research, and she always tries to look for existing open channels first before creating her own:

> If I'm working on something and I want to keep the channel private, then it's also an interesting kind of prompt for me to understand why, is it that I'm taking too much reference from these things and perhaps it would be better to make it open and make sure that you're not like secretly being derivative. I feel the public-private thing is interesting because it's also about honesty or making sure that you're not ripping people off or getting too influenced by things. "Oh, these are my like deep cut, like private references. And like, that's my secret sauce for how I like do cool design."
> <span>–Gemma Copeland</span>

## <span class="arena">Are.na</span>, a Digital Garden in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Cozy&nbsp;Web?

This concluding part ventures into the similarities shared by <br><span class="arena">Are.na</span> with the realm of digital gardens while remaining distinct due to its enclosed platform nature—which Venkatesh Rao termed the _Cozy Web_[^CozyWeb]. While <span class="arena">Are.na</span> is often likened to a network of interconnected digital gardens for creative individuals, its complete feature set and content accessibility remain confined within a paid community membership. In envisioning the contemporary web as a primarily privatized domain of walled gardens—dominated by massive information highways—digital gardens emerge as unique public and handmade alternatives transcending these walled confines, which piqued the interest of some interviewees within the creative community.

[^CozyWeb]: RAO, Ventakesh, 2019, The Extended Internet Universe, Ribbonfarm Studio [online] [https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/the-extended-internet-universe](https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/the-extended-internet-universe) [consulted: 2023.11.25]

(figure: content/images/Paul-Ford-Laurel-Schwulst.png caption: Quote from Paul Ford, 2016, Reboot the World, illustrated in Sparrows talking about the future of the Web by Laurel Schwulst for The Library of Practical and Conceptual Resources)

Caulfield’s understanding of digital gardens earlier introduced, implies gardening is not about using specific technologies but rather how to rethink our online behavior towards information, through personal and explorable online space. As our Web navigation progressively delved into _streams_ of collapsed information into single-track timelines of events–from social media feeds and chats–the lifespan of information is limited and not designed to be accumulated and grow over time as implies Gemma Copeland:

> It's about not trying to use things that are always distracting you and also building that kind of collective knowledge base over time. WhatsApp or Slack, everything gets lost in the stream. You're not building anything long-term, you're just kind of chatting and it's chaotic, etc. 
> <span>–Gemma Copeland</span>

Through its introverted interactions and interconnected architecture, <span class="arena">Are.na</span> constitutes a distinctive response to streams, which Gemma depicts as “such a polite platform, where people respect each other's little gardens that they're working on. Every now and again, people will add something to an open channel, and it feels like you've had this weird kind of very quiet interaction with another person, which is super nice.”

### Digital gardens: not just a blog

Digital gardens, unlike traditional blogs and platform feeds, eschew the chronological or algorithmic confines of a timeline and instead, emphasize manual contextual relationships and associative links, similar to <span class="arena">Are.na</span>. In there, as the following examples I provided in this public <span class="arena">Are.na</span> channel[^arenagarden], the structure isn't tethered to dates; rather, it thrives on interconnections between posts based on themes, topics, and shared contexts. Maggie Appleton aptly describes these gardens as having “many points of entry but no defined pathways.” HyphaCoop’s digital garden[^hyphacoop] is a good example showcasing interconnection as the background of the landing page:

(figure: content/images/hypha.png caption: Hypha Coop’s digital garden)

<br class="breakpage">

This **topology** over a timeline allows digital garden readers to traverse content via bi-directional linking, thematic piles[^piles], nested folders[^folders], tags[^tags], advanced search bars, and visual node graphs[^graphview], creating a non-linear, explorative experience, while questioning the established norms of a _personal website_ playfully. While <span class="arena">Are.na</span> does not use all of the above features, bi-directional linking and nesting channels in others certainly reflects this nonlinear exploration.

**Continuous growth** is fundamental to digital gardens, and <br><span class="arena">Are.na</span>. Unlike formal articles, essays, or presentation mood boards, these spaces evolve perpetually. Emphasizing editability, there's no notion of a final version—ideas are seeded, nurtured, and continuously tended, allowing for feedback, revision, and expansion. This fosters a low-pressure environment, promoting the organic evolution of thoughts and ideas over time, offering readers insights into the author's thinking process and embracing imperfection and growth. This corroborates with public and open <span class="arena">Are.na</span> channels.

The essence of **learning in public** is central to digital gardening, encouraging sharing and learning during the learning process, not as an _expert_ or _individual genius_ retrospectively, which <span class="arena">Are.na</span> partly encourages, if members actively use open channels. Digital gardening is the _Domestic Cozy_ response to the professional personal blog, both intimate and public, weird and welcoming. Responsibility is integral; notes can be categorized metaphorically as _seedlings_, _budding_, or _evergreen_, signifying their development stage. Gwern.net[^gwern] exemplifies this with meta-reflections on each entry, including topic tags, dates, stage tags, certainty levels, and importance rankings.

(figure: content/images/index.png caption: Digital garden of Gwern Branwen, which they assembled through expressing different levels of completeness)

These gardens challenge the norms of personal websites, aiming for **deep contextualization** amidst the chaos of the internet, for which <span class="arena">Are.na</span> has room for improvement. Yet both <span class="arena">Are.na</span> and handmade digital gardens emphasize **content diversity**, welcoming various formats like podcasts, videos, illustrations, tweets, and academic papers, fostering a rich multimedia environment.

Independently owning a digital garden is pivotal and radical; it ensures control and **ownership**, diverging from cozy walled gardens and platforms like Facebook or Twitter. None of these platforms are designed to help you slowly build and weave personal knowledge. Except for <span class="arena">Are.na</span>, most of them actively fight against it. 

Additionally, as Daniel states, “[platforms] come and go, no matter how powerful or stable they seem to be”, your writing and creations can sink with it. Almost none of them have an easy export button. And they certainly will not hand you your data in a transferable format. This reflects the topics of Data and Privacy Concerns within Antitrust Laws about considerations of how dominant tech platforms handle user data. This involves examining whether the collection and use of data create unfair competitive advantages or harm consumer privacy.

While digital gardens currently end up being **solitary** endeavors, efforts are underway to create multiplayer spaces, which <span class="arena">Are.na</span> feels relevant for creatives as a community garden. For handmade gardens, _Webmentions_[^webmentions] is an alternative option to gather a community of personal websites.

[^webmentions]: PARECKI, Aaron, WEBMENTION [online] [https://webmention.io/](https://webmention.io/) [consulted: 2023.11.25]

In essence, digital gardens symbolize a shift towards a more intentional, less performative, yet engaging and personalized approach to sharing knowledge. They encapsulate the dichotomy between chaos and **cultivation**, embracing **imperfection**, continuous growth, and responsible sharing in a multimedia-rich, non-linear environment—all while securing ownership and control within the vast expanse of the internet. <span class="arena">Are.na</span> partly encapsulates such common interests and features of more radically handmade gardens, and serves as a walled doorway for how creatives got intertwined with the digital gardening narrative. In this platform, the choice is theirs to pivot from private to public and community-scaled collaboration and sharing.
