# Gathering as a radical creative process 

## 1.1 On Gathering

Following Le Guin's book, Designer Mindy Seu expands on a contemporary approach. (imagenote: content/images/NewWomansSurvival.webp caption: New Woman's Survival Catalog) (imagenote: content/images/cyberfeminism-index.webp caption: Cyberfeminism Index) In her essay _On Gathering_[^Seu], Seu implies that being a gatherer is an essential human activity, especially in the digital age. She defines the process of gathering to "aggregate, together with collaborators, disparate pieces from an ecosystem, and develop the appropriate container for each collection." 

Moreover, she explores how digital platforms and online events have transformed the way people gather and share information. Bringing different examples of collective collections, such as the *New Woman's Survival Catalog* and the _Cyberfeminism Index_, Seu explores the evolving nature of gathering, blurring the lines between container and content, and challenging the traditional notions of fixed, solitary authorship, as she states:

> Gathering stories is radical because it refuses to give the gatherer all of the credit. The collector-collection dynamic is deliberately broken. The person who puts it together is only one of many parts.

## 1.2 Digital gathering methods

Interviews conducted with nine european-based creatives (artists, designers, developers) in summer 2023 highlight the diversity of digital gathering methods and motivations. They explore the shift from traditional to online gathering methods, emphasizing the role of UGC platforms in personal knowledge curation. Contrarily to the vertically defined classification of 20th century Paul Otlet’s Mundaneum analog knowledge archives, UGC Platforms allow users to freely constitute their own curation into self-labeled knowledge base, by either uploading or connecting any content found online either inside the platform or outside. 

While **browser** tools, **social media**, **journaling**, **search engines** are indeed recurrent within creative research, a key typology of platforms for collection and curation refers to **visual discovery engines**, such as Pinterest (2010) with its masonry grid feed of images, Tumblr (2007) with its vertically-stacked stream of blog content, and Are.na, at crossroads between creative social network, knowledge management and visual discovery platform. Those platforms for collection considerably help the gathering of visual culture, fostering creative endeavors, at varying degrees of curation quality and collaborative features (**web-clipping,** social features), depending on the community’s content and use cases. This subset of UGC platforms could be neologized as User-Gathered Curated Collaborative Creative Content platforms (UGCCCC).


## 1.3 Creativity, Knowledge, and Collection

In common sense, making a _collection_ would mean bringing together elements due to their value, attractiveness, or interestingness, “over a period of time", “for study, comparison, or exhibition or as a hobby." A collection could bring quite disparate elements while sharing a few common points, or _associations_. Emphasizing, on the way of thinking, the connections, and associations, are key to consider how creative practices collect, connect by association, to grow and organize knowledge over time, and to develop documentation, new skills, crafts, or ideas. As swiss curator, critic, and historian of art Hans Ulrich Obrist implies:[^obrist]

> To make a collection is to find, acquire, organize, and store items […]. It is also, inevitably, a way of thinking about the world – the connections and principles that produce a collection contain assumptions, juxtapositions, findings, experimental possibilities, and associations. Collection-making, you could say, is a method of producing knowledge.

[^obrist]: OBRIST, Hans Ulrich, 2014. _Ways of curating_. First American edition. New York : Faber and Faber, Inc. ISBN 978-0-86547-819-0.

Similarly to Obrist’s definition of collection, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi defines _creativity_ as expressing unusual thoughts, and to help experience the world in novel ways, implying originality, and playfulness. [^Mihaly] _Creative Research_ then, can be refered to a form of inquiry and collection that goes beyond traditional, empirical methods and incorporates creative processes and artistic exploration. Associated with fields such as the arts, design, and humanities, the goal is therefore not only to discover new information but also to generate novel ideas, perspectives, or expressions, to share informations, through art-based production or building knowledge.

## 1.4 Perspectives from Creative Practitioners

 

This online gathering as means to generate knowledge is firstly echoed by one of my interviewees, Florian Hilt, 3D artist and photographer based in Lausanne. By pooling visual cues from a plurality of **algorithmic feeds** (Instagram, Twitter and TikTok), he then merges his findings into curated Are.na containers: 

> I'm based on a notion of micro universes and on the theory of attraction and repulsion. What interests me a lot when I have access to all this content is to be able to mix it together. It helps me to create projects as I'm building by association and repulsion of ideas.

UGCCCC platforms could therefore help creatives to create compatible containers for gathering and build their personal knowledge, free of imposed classification systems and norms. Yet, those platforms raise challenges in the endeavors to manage and organize information across multiple platforms, sometimes leading to chaotic methods as artist Lucas Erin states:

> I use several of them on a _seasonal_ basis, but then I have a real problem mastering this data. My problem is that I have physical sketchbooks, I use Notes quite a lot on my iPhone and then on the other side I have a Pinterest folder and then a folder on Instagram and then behind that there's Arena. It's all a bit mixed up. Not to mention the InDesign documents in which I try to make pdfs moodboards… My use of platforms is completely chaotic.

According to Jonas Pelzer, Berlin-based designer and developper, some platforms feel more suitable than others, while Daniel Robert Prieto underlines the ease-of-use needed in gathering without interface design restraints:

 

> I tried multiple research tools in the past, most of them don’t exist anymore. But I always came back to a non-collaborative standard setup with bookmarks and notes before using Are.na, which is the first platform I’m really happy with. […] In addition to my notes app and my analog notebook, I mainly use Are.na for research and organisation. I also use Twitter, Mastodon and Instagram, but I don’t consider them comparable. I sometimes look for specific resources on Twitter and Mastodon but that’s as far as the research part goes. 

> Tumblr. Why do I like it? Because it's just one big stream of images, it's so simple. There are tools for downloading the whole of Tumblr.

> – Daniel Robert Prieto

Some interviewees also quote recurrent platforms and sources of inspiration, using models of subscription, to maintain a controlled curated news feed center when subscribed pages updates new content. Via **RSS** (Really Simple Syndication) technology for american artist Baker Wardlaw, or specific **blogs **via Tumblr for industrial designer Aurélie Vial:

> There's a Tumblr[^inspirimgrafik] I think I've been going to for ten years because it's a source that's reliable for me. It's still nurtured and active. And the quality of the image compilation is pretty constant. I mean, it's never disappointed me. 

> – Aurélie Vial

Using tools does not have to be by default and one may not suffice. Most of the interviewees generally research through a combination of platforms to develop a singular process. The choice of a specific platform can comes out of curiosity of the latest tool, or alternatively, some interviewees have a rather opinionated approach to selecting them, as explains Gemma Copeland, Lisbon-based australian designer and member of [Common Knowledge](https://commonknowledge.coop/), a not-for-profit worker cooperative:

> For Common Knowledge we use so many tools. Over the last couple of years, we spread out from wanting this big monolithic tool that does everything. This kind of generalist approach of trying to be this all-in-one thing is actually not the best because it doesn't do anything well. Tools that do one thing well, but are interoperable with other tools, I think that's the gold standards. We really like tools that are quite opinionated, particularly those that are not about trying to get your attention all the time. So, for example, we don't use Slack.

> – Gemma Copeland

All-in-one **organisational** tools such as Notion (2018) or Linear (2019) were mentionned by Frederik Mahler-Andersen, Gemma Copeland and Daniel Robert Prieto, whether it is for project management, note-taking code snippets, agenda, or maintaining personal CRM [^PrietoNotion]

[^PrietoNotion]: [https://thisisgrey.notion.site/Favourites-directory-c10bf6c6701540c387ce1ebfb1135a4c](https://thisisgrey.notion.site/Favourites-directory-c10bf6c6701540c387ce1ebfb1135a4c)

**Online browsers** already allow native functionalities such as **bookmarking** and **saving images** on local folders on one’s device, which in my own experience was the very first method I have used while starting my studies in Art and Design. In addition, **search engines** such as Google Images search – heavily used by Aurélie to source images found on UGC platforms – is also one of the most basic approach to practice visual discoveries, before accessing more specific **photo sharing platforms** such as Flickr (2004) or **visual search engines platforms** such as Pinterest. As Brussels-based designer Emilie Pillet states:

> I record a lot of references. It's a lot easier to create this sort of local library on my computer and remember where things are than an online platform where I'll quickly forget what I've seen.

> – Emilie Pillet

In addition to a preference of more tangible containers of inspiration, Emilie emphasizes the printed objects inspiring her “more than platforms”, as better curated flows of references, redistributing the value of her used platforms for storage, if not made on her computer. Daniel Robert Prieto reflects on his pre-WWW early print-only gatherings:

> When I was 18, 20, the only way was, design books. I spent an insane amount of money just buying design books […] spending days and days in the design library, going through books, buying, sharing, with other friends, exchanging books, that was the place to eat design, absorb design. […] The book in itself, it's curated, in an order, it is selected, it's around a topic. You take that for granted, you think that reality is like this. When you go to the internet, that curation doesn't exist. It's a bucket. 


## 1.5 Challenges of passive gathering and context collapse 

**Social medias** such as Instagram (2010), X (Twitter, 2006), or TikTok (2016) or **Fediverse** Mastodon (2016) propose endless algorithmically filtered streams of time-bound content. In those, the use of features such as recommender systems, likes, favourites, hashtags, comments, followers can be used to store references and connect with their creators. As Florian Hilt states, his gathering method passes through the passive visual trigger of the like button, helping him to maintain a history of his latest liked posts: “On Instagram you can access your likes, up to three hundred, which I find quite good for my methodology because it allows me to renew myself and not go back too far in time.” Similar visual triggers methods – between obsessive consumption and productive **death-scrolling** – were discussed by Daniel Robert Prieto regarding his navigation of the Tumblr feed:

> The reason I was using Tumblr was the shortcuts. I could go with J and K. I think K was to save it, and I could go very quick. I couldn’t go with the mouse.

> – Daniel Robert Prieto

Similar time-bound feeds of content can be seen in **chat applications**, in which Discord (2015) and Meta’s WhatsApp (2009) for example, can be used to share references and interact with people about them. Lucas Erin for example, regularly send to fellow practitioners references through chat to later on create moments of discussion in real life. To further add possibilities of chat exchanges of references, WhatsApp iOS[^WhatsAppOCR] rolled out this year features such as text detection in images, allowing for instant lookup and translation. 

[^WhatsAppOCR]: [https://mybroadband.co.za/news/software/484119-whatsapp-adds-text-detection-feature-for-images.html](https://mybroadband.co.za/news/software/484119-whatsapp-adds-text-detection-feature-for-images.html)

**Journaling** and **note-taking** is also recurrent across most of the interviews. Chronological journals such as Apple Notes used by Lucas Erin and Baker Wardlaw, can sometimes bring further context. Gemma Copeland and Baker Wardlaw invest **personal knowledge management** tools such as Obsidian (2020) or Roam Research (2019), in order to build notes as a digital garden and experiment with a **wiki** information architecture to enhance associative thinking:

> In my personal practice or, as I'm working on common knowledge projects, it's mainly, arena for references and then obsidian for note-taking, which is also like a digital garden.

> – Gemma Copeland

Mentionned platforms are not without detriments to creativity. Specific issues of **context collapse** are widely expressed from the overwhelming consumption of content tending to lack source and context. Algorithmics feeds are designed to stimulate a constant use of an application and maintain attention of the user through ever renewing what is shown to the user. With advances in algorithms, feeds using recommender systems moved out of initial chronological manually curated feeds, which could lead to feeling trapped in **aesthetic bubbles**, and lose personal need of control in curation expressed by Emilie:

> I would never use Pinterest, for example, to look for references. I have the impression that with all the platforms, it sends back the same references, the same aesthetics. 

> – Emilie Pillet

According to Daniel, “Images on the internet don't have any context. They don't have a story. They don't have a client. They have nothing. They're almost like in an empty museum.” Aurélie states that on Are.na: “everything is set up so that you caption your images and source them. That's why I don't use Pinterest when it's really about looking at these images and feeding yourself with something, because it scrambles my brain.” Questionning the recommendation aspect, Lucas remains centered on contextualizing content outside of platforms and making it his own internally: 

> I feel that part of my job is to go and find it. So I wonder how it's offered to me, and if it's offered to me, is it offered to everyone else? […] I like the idea of being a bookworm to find information. And the question isn't necessarily whether it's true or not, it's rather what I do with it and how I transform or use it.

> – Lucas Erin

Alternative solutions within online gatherings, were suggested by Gemma through her personal blog. More precisely, Gemma’s blog [^gemmablog] is not aiming to “necessarily producing original ideas because nothing is original, everything's a remix. But at least, to kind of draw out those threads and spend a bit more time on them and go further with the curation.” as she states:

> Part of wanting to build a blog was that my practice was too much just collecting and consuming, and it felt in a way passive, and not ever working through in greater detail what I actually thought about things, almost going too far onto this kind of like intuitive collecting and not enough synthesis and articulating my own point of view.

> – Gemma Copeland

[^gemmablog]: [https://gemmacope.land/writing/](https://gemmacope.land/writing/)

This contextualization of intuitive collections is depicted as a internal digestion process for Lucas, who is less about using platforms and more about internalizing ideas and references, to prevent risks of altering his artistic practice:

> I'm afraid that accumulating too many visual references is detrimental to creativity. […] When I keep something in my head, there's a part of digestion of the image, concept or idea, until it really becomes mine. As a result, I have a problem of legitimacy when I gather too much information, too many sources, too many references. I get the impression that what I'm doing looks exactly like what I'm accumulating. 

> – Lucas Erin

However, on some platforms such as Pinterest, a more collaborative gathering method with AI and recommender engines could help the **serendipity** process in fruitful ways for Aurélie. Using Pinterest to suggest similar images from a single source, she still highlights risks regarding the lack of sources and context around the results:

> There are times when I go back to Pinterest because I need to start with an image and try to open up the field as much as possible and I'm offered a ton of images. […] I spent a lot of time extracting images from these databases on Pinterest. There's extremely little referencing of images, there are no captions. I do the work of looking up where these images come from. Sometimes it leads you to other images.

Throughout his career and the multiple platforms used, from Tumblr to X and Are.na, Daniel also stated on his obsessive personality towards gathering his “sheer amount of shit”: 

> I've always been very insecure in the sense of, not falling behind, but of culture or ideas moving into one direction. And for me to miss that… I always have to spend time absorbing design.

> – Daniel Robert Prieto

In exploring gathering on online knowledge networks and user-aggregated platforms, it becomes evident that platforms such as Pinterest, Tumblr, and Are.na, play a transformative role in fostering alternative creative practices. They enable pooling of visual cues, the creation of compatible containers for knowledge, and the construction of personal knowledge bases. However, amidst their benefits, challenges persist in managing information chaos and overcoming context collapse and how collaborative they are and influence collective gathering.
