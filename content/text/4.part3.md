# The case of Are.na

## Definition Arena

Are.na being used by all the interviewees, it is interesting to note its name. While the actual definition of the term _Arena_ refers in its physical meaning to an “enclosed area for public entertainment”, another definition states it as “sphere of interest, activity, or competition”, even a “place or situation for controversy”, which somehow makes sense if we sense the plurality of content gathered within user-aggregated-content platforms, which somehow all tends to be enclosed _silos_ of knowledge open to communities, however not universally available and accessible. Nevertheless, looking at how creatives came to appropriate various ways of gathering and collection-making in those to fuel their creation process, to work collectively on pedagogical or business aspects is key to this project. By growing and curating a personal storage space of knowledge pooled online from other users, we will inquire about how and why creatives from different practices use and situate different models of research, curation, contribution, and motivations to either gatekeep an intimate knowledge, or at the contrary share publicly, contribute, and encourage collaborative research towards models of abundance.

What stands out from this platform compared to others? What are the influences?



* How Are.na defines itself, and influences by founders
* Financial sustainability aspects, paid community


## Use-cases from interviews

Can the tool be used, misused, subverted?



* Use cases: pédagogiques, solo, collaborative restreint, open-edit, api et custom tools 
* Channel examples from interviews/others

> There's a whole arena channel of people using arena for websites. I do feel a bit  sneaky sometimes because I also use it to like, post all the images on my site and therefore not pay for my own hosting. Thank you. I'm just like using your service.

Gemma Copeland

> I wouldn't say that I hack Arena, but I would say that I have a fairly conventional use of a tool that's relatively unconventional in the sense that the first time you show it to people, they're are like "what's this thing?" 

Baker Wardlaw

> I don't know if it's a personal choice or if it just happened, but I'm not at all a participative person, I don't have social networks. Except Are.na, where sometimes I add things. I don't just take blocks, part of what I add is images I've taken from sites, from Google, from Pinterest. But I also, and this happens quite often, scan things from books or other sources and add them to Arena. In fact, I feed a bit of content.

## Tension points

To what extent does the tool shape the creative research and practice?



* interview quotes specific to are.na

**Frequency**

> I've always been very insecure in the sense of, not falling behind, but of culture or ideas moving into one direction. And for me to miss that. So I always have to spend time absorbing design.

Daniel Robert Prieto

> I have noticed one thing by the sheer amount of shit that I collect. You have to have an obsessive personality or like a mind that goes too quick into one direction, which is not good sometimes

Daniel Robert Prieto

**Contributing Ratio**

> I feel pretty guilty because that's what I did in the beginning too, looking for stuff in the source code. And that's what taught me how to do a lot of things. And in the end, you want to give something back that's been useful to you. It's like with P2P downloading, there are seeders and leechers, and I think I'm more of a seeder than a leecher unfortunately, but I'd like to change my ratio.

Frederik Mahler-Andersen

> If I have this idea for a cool channel or I want to collect this thing. Usually I'll do a search first. Does it exist already? And if it does, and it's open, then I'll just add to that.

Gemma Copeland

> I put some documents online, some images, I shared some stuff that's pretty hard to find on the internet. I put them in public so that people could have access to them.

Florian Hilt

> Arena is such a polite platform, where people respect each other's little gardens that they're working on. Every now and again, people will add something to an open channel, and it feels like you've had this weird kind of very quiet interaction with another person, which is super nice.

Gemma Copeland

> Are.na, for example, is a small community. There are a lot of people who share a lot of things, with a lot of good will, which is great. But there are also a lot of people who have so many private things, I imagine. It's a bit restrictive. But I think the code is the same, maybe a little more participative.

Frederik Mahler-Andersen

**Solo / Team / Collaborations**

> If I started having a public Are.na, where I collaborate with people, it would be at some point when I have a shared studio.

Florian Hilt

> If you're going to collaborate with other people, it's less about like the dumping of shit and more about communication. So what I've found is, just spend more time on zoom, exchanging images.

Daniel Robert Prieto

> Collaborating with someone, I've tried it a couple of times, it never worked. Also because I'm too insane, in the sense of like, I post a lot. And then, people post just two things. It's the rhythm. I would need to find someone that posts just as much as me. And there are not that many people. 

Daniel Robert Prieto

> I've met a bunch of people on Arena. The place where I worked in London, a place called Future Corp. When I emailed Mark, when I had moved to London and was looking for a job, he recognized my name from Arena. And that's kind of how I, I got the job. And then, we went to New York and actually met the people from arena. I've met a load of people through it. And, you know, like, in a weird way, because I guess there's obviously not really messaging on it.

Gemma Copeland

**Self Promotion VS Genuine Altruism**

> The problem is not technical, it's cultural. There was a culture before of people posting for the sake of posting because they wanted to do something good with the world. I remember there's one guy that I downloaded the whole site, that was collecting, cigarette packs. He had a collection of like thousands. Like fucking thousands on that shittiest website that you could imagine. And the guy just posted it there. That spirit is what's missing these days. We have that insane technology. Nobody's posting dog shit on anything. And when they do, everything is too self conscious, too self promotional. Very few people are just doing things for the sake of like, Oh, it's beautiful things. That's the problem. Everybody is already hustling. And that sucks. Fuck hustling. 

Daniel Robert Prieto

**Private Gatekeeping / Publicly Sharing Knowledge**

> All private, because I don't like it. And at the same time, as I'm following people I'm interested in, I figure that if they were private too, it would make the whole thing a lot less interesting. I have to admit I'm not comfortable with the idea of making public my own research or things I've spent a long time finding out. I think I like to keep it to myself.

Emilie Pillet

> If many times there's like a topic or an idea, I put it there and I start collecting 20 images, but like there are no more images that I find, that I find naturally, because that, it's almost like that river goes nowhere, it just like dissolves. So then what I do with these things is keep them private, and if I see that after collecting, it becomes a thing, then maybe I publish it and make it public.

Daniel Robert Prieto

> Having the channels open, that was a decision I made a few years ago, this idea of like not trying to gatekeep or say "these things are my own" because at the end of the day, it's a collection of other people's things. So why should I be "Oh, this is mine as the curator."

Gemma Copeland

> when you see everything, you start getting a sense of like, ah, this guy is into this. You start getting a sense of what the aesthetics of the personality of the person like selecting or whatever, but you need to see like 300 images to be able to see that. It's like you're going, scavenging through their brain and their soul.

Daniel Robert Prieto

> Personally, I like to share what I find. But on platforms like Are.na or others, I'm much more restrictive, and I don't really know why, but I think it's the oral sharing that attracts me more.

Frederik Mahler-Andersen

> When you see the library of someone you don't know or someone who isn't there, you're making a form of judgment. 

Lucas Erin

> The tricky part is that it only speaks to me, it's a lot about feeling. If I show my Are.na blocks to someone else, for example, it's a bit sensitive.

Florian Hilt

> I don't see what this would bring to someone else in the sense that it would just speak to them visually or textually. For me it's really ideas put together in my head that mean something in my head.

Florian Hilt

> If I'm working on something and I want to keep the channel private, then it's also an interesting kind of prompt for me to understand why, is it that I'm taking too much reference from these things and perhaps it would be better to make it open and make sure that you're not like secretly being derivative. I feel the public private thing is interesting because it's also about honesty or making sure that you're not ripping people off or getting too influenced by things basically. "Oh, these are my like deep cut, like private references. And like, that's my secret sauce for how I like do cool design."

> I have certain things that remain public and I like to keep them public. I have this channel of Swiss logos that I find quite funny, it's even open to contribute. And some things… it's not about keeping it to myself or having a private collection, it's rather I didn't really go back over it. I think that before publishing something, I tend to want to go over it myself, to see what I'm sharing.

Frederik Mahler-Andersen

**Ownership: Intime des idées / **

> When I was younger, I was much more protective of my links, my discoveries. But then at some point, you start realizing it doesn't really matter. You share it, it's even better. You meet people, you help other people, who cares? It's not like they're going to steal your findings because they are just there. 

Daniel Robert Prieto

> I've never felt the need to communicate a universe. For me, my universe is internal, it's intimate, and afterwards I convey it differently, because it's directly in the work and I don't need to use it or describe it to someone.

Lucas Erin

> Is there any point in me giving my tips on how I make certain images when in fact the result is the image? One of the funny things about photography is that sometimes I don't know how I did it, you can make images in completely chaotic and questionable conditions.

Florian Hilt

> I guess one of the continuous lines of thinking that I've been interested in over the years is trying to move away from this idea of designers as individual genius. Instead, recognizing you're kind of a sum of all these influences, etc. I try to be quite public about who those influences are for me.

Gemma Copeland

> There's a culture of singularity, wit, genius, talent and so on, so to have an album in which all the references are accessible, that must scare a lot of people, because it kills the idea of originality. Even if reproduction is completely assumed in all contemporary discourse in the art world, and there's nothing new anymore, it certainly remains a fantasy.  

Lucas Erin

**Economic Value of Research Skills**

> If someone had access to this content, it would be an access to the whole way in which you develop your visual culture and therefore also a part of your work. But at the same time, it's never so much a secret, because I really do use visual references, and I often show them to my clients.

Aurélie Vial

> On these sites where you archive things, I can see how my ability to search for images has evolved, and I think it's actually an important skill in my work. Not everyone can do good image research. And so, I have the impression that there's a part of it where you have to preserve it from the outside because it's a job. And not everyone has the same ability to do good reference research and to be well referenced.

Aurélie Vial

> I think it's part of your quality as a designer, to do image research well, to be very well referenced and to know how to open up the scope. There's a part where it's almost a kind of professional secret.

Aurélie Vial

> In a job interview, you can almost sell it by saying "I'm coming with my reference books, and my reference books are really good."

Aurélie Vial

**Decontextualisation des references VS blogs:**

> Images on the internet don't have any context. They don't have a story. They don't have a client. They have nothing. They're almost like in an empty museum, you would find a lonely picture without a description of what it is?

Daniel Robert Prieto

> On Arena, everything is set up so that you caption your images and source them. Whereas on Pinterest, you feel that it's a mass thing, and then the images, they come back all the time. That's why I don't use Pinterest when it's really about looking at these images and feeding yourself with something, because it scrambles my brain.

Aurélie Vial

> My blog was meant to be this kind of step of like, not necessarily producing original ideas because nothing is original, everything's a remix. But at least, to kind of draw out those threads and spend a bit more time on them and go further with the curation.

Gemma Copeland

> Part of wanting to build a blog was, my practice was too much just collecting and consuming and it felt in a way passive and not ever working through in greater detail what I actually thought about things, almost going too far onto this kind of like intuitive collecting and not enough synthesis and articulating my own point of view.

Gemma Copeland

**Connection semantique des elements: Context VS Knowledge**

> Are.na is also sometimes the same phenomenon as Instagram, it can be a bit "death scrolling" when you follow too many people. It starts to snowball, and then you lose track a bit.

Frederik Mahler-Andersen

> What you need, it's not information but the patience to look through them, and not many people have that.

Daniel Robert Prieto

**Curation VS recommendations ou uniformisation des références**

> For me, as a web designer, when I see too many websites, they're all a bit custom-made. All with graphics that are a bit too much, then I get lost. The people I follow on Are.na, apart from certain artists etc., are a lot of people who do the same thing as me. So you end up in a spiral where you also see their references and make them your own.

Frederik Mahler-Andersen

> I'm going to try to find things in a more organic way, because I have the impression that on these platforms, there are a lot of people reposting and as time goes by, the content becomes very polished and you can't find anything out of the ordinary. 

Emilie Pillet

> I'm afraid that accumulating too many visual references is detrimental to creativity. […] When I keep something in my head, there's a part of digestion of the image, concept or idea, until it really becomes mine. As a result, I have a problem of legitimacy when I gather too much information, too many sources, too many references. I get the impression that what I'm doing looks exactly like what I'm accumulating. 

Lucas Erin

> I feel that part of my job is to go and find it. So I wonder how it's offered to me, and if it's offered to me, is it offered to everyone else? […] I like the idea of being a bookworm to find information. And the question isn't necessarily whether it's true or not, it's rather what I do with it and how I transform or use it.

Lucas Erin

**Influencing the practice**

> Economically, no. Like, zero percent. Other designers don't make you money. Designers are not going to give you clients. Designers are your enemy. You are competing for the same clients with them. Don't make friends with designers if you're trying to get clients. So, like, monetarily, no. But in terms of inspiration of course, 100%.

Daniel Robert Prieto

> On a commercial level, the stakes for someone who's a developer/graphic designer are different. If someone were to steal that, you're so much into github code sharing that the notion of copyright is less present. I'm not at all afraid of someone stealing my references.

Frederik Mahler-Andersen

> From fairly early on working in design studios, I just became allergic to this idea of there being these kind of star designers struck by genius. After working in places where you see what goes on, these are these people who are famous. But then there's a whole studio of people working for not very much money and working really hard, and not really getting credit.

## Conclusion part 3:

Next, we will compare digitals gardens to streams of content such as blogs and social media chronological feeds. We will also question how user-generated-creative-curated-collaborative platforms could somehow be envisioned as digital community gardens. This chapter will eventually help us not only to observe personal gardens but also to open up on decentralized alternatives to a current state of a centralized corporated web, majoritary owned GAFAs.
