# Introduction

This master's thesis explores the potential offered by online collaborative platforms in facilitating creative processes, examined through qualitative interviews involving artists, designers, and developers. With the emergence of Web 2.0 (2003) and subsequent User-Generated Content (UGC) platforms like Tumblr (2007), Pinterest (2010), and <span class="arena">Are.na</span> (2012), creatives have significantly enriched their visual culture. These platforms provide dedicated spaces for various purposes, spanning from passive media consumption to more active engagement methods such as documentation, curation, contextualization, collection-making, collaboration, and resource-sharing. The investigation aims to shed light on the often undisclosed creative processes employed by individuals in these domains, and how in turn they are influenced by platforms, and could help foster better understanding and as an example, facilitate billing procedures.

If the beginnings of the Internet were accompanied by an ideology of accessibility and sharing comparable to a new form of public space, referred to by founder of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee as “a collaborative medium, a place where we [could] all meet and read and write.”[^BernersLee], its development, including UGCs, is a form that refutes this principle. Owing to advancements in recommendation algorithms, miniaturization of hardware, wireless connectivity, and expanded data storage capabilities, most current UGC platforms exist as private data repositories within the corporate sphere of the Web, predominantly centralized by tech giants like GAFAM (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.).

Web 2.0 also witnessed the rise of mobile devices, altering user interactions. In December 2010, desktops held 95.9% of the market share compared to mobile's 4.1%, but by September 2023, mobile devices claimed a 53% share[^stats]. The decline of the World Wide Web is attributed to the surge in dedicated mobile applications released by device manufacturers’ application stores such as Apple's App Store or Google's Play Store (both 2008), overshadowing traditional web usage and aligning with the dynamics of platform capitalism. As asserted by Knopf[^Knopf], the structure of social media platforms is engineered to retain users within these “walled garden” enclosed environments, solely focused on content consumption, rather than interconnection.

UGC services and networks foster a notion of a somewhat ambiguous “semi-public” digital space for human interaction, as highlighted by Ertzscheid[^Ertzscheid]. However, these platforms, according to Tariq Krim's _Slow Web Initiative_[^slowweb], are “greedy for our data”, confining interactions and content behind barriers, via restricting access, relying on user data consent, offering limited free access (freemium), premium subscriptions, or demanding attention in exchange for access. Whereas, according to Jenny Odell:[^Odell]

> A public, noncommercial space demands nothing from you in order for you to enter, nor for you to stay; the most obvious difference between public space and other spaces is that you don't have to buy anything, or pretend to buy something, to be there.

But throughout the interviews and the Web, <span class="arena">Are.na</span> is acknowledged as a digital garden. This paradox raised inquiries on which specific attributes make a private UGC platform suitable as a semi-public digital garden. In a 2019 conference[^platformattr], <span class="arena">Are.na</span> Co-founder Charles Broskoski developed the following attributes of a UGC platform. Do platforms, encourage active or passive use, regarding aspects of cognitive load? According to Geert Lovink, “Today’s psychological platforms offer personalized, fuzzy information for the swiping dazed and confused. We do not know what we want, but we want it so much.”[^Lovink] In a 2020 US study, passive use of Instagram was more common than active use (48.48% vs. 20.79%).[^activepassive]

A _garden_ draws a sense of public view and access. Commonly defined as a “rich-well cultivated region” where things are “cultivated”, they can be displayed “[…] so that the public can go and see them [plants and flowers].”[^gardendef] Out of this context, radical handmade[^carpenter0] and public uses of the Web re-emerge, reminiscent of the Web’s early vernacular days.

The individually-scaled practice of _Digital gardening_ then, refers to planting _seeds_, cultivating knowledge over time, on your fully owned and handmade corner of the Web, without restrictions to specific platforms or technologies. It is another neologism to the list of nature-inspired terms to describe technological actions and methods, dating from the nineties via _Hypertext Gardens_[^HTgardens] (1998), early Hypertext (1965) experiments within the Web by Mark Bernstein. The essay metaphorically featured topics of free internet exploration within open gardens and wilderness. While being less centered on building personal digital spaces, it emphasized the experience flows and how Web contents could be organized.

Re-emerged in 2015 by Mike Caulfield’s conference and essay[^CaulfieldTXT] _The Garden and the Stream, a Technopastoral_, Caulfield underlined the need to reclaim independent ownership from the corporated Web platforms and social media, by setting up a personal yet public digital space of knowledge curation on the Web, for content to be de-streamed from algorithmic feeds and cultivated over time.

Therefore, the research question I endeavor to answer is:

#### How using online user-aggregated content platforms and digital gardens to gather and share knowledge can transform (or not) a creative practice?

This question will address the ambiguous tension point of how creatives actively use those platforms, versus how those platforms develop passive influence on their processes in return.

Passively liking an image is not the same as connecting it to a curated folder actively defined by the user. Is the platform open-ended or restrictive for how one can use it? What is the focus or purpose of the platform? The scale and diversity of the population of the platform are also highly linked to what content (its quality and context) is generated on it. To what extent the platform allows the interconnection of Web contents outside its walls? To what extent the platform gives a sense of ownership to its population to steer the direction of the platform? What is the method of communication between members on the platform? Is it considered introverted, with minimal features, or extraverted with full multimedia communications? In this sense, does the platform allows meaningful ways to be alone on it? Last but not least, do the platforms target individual gain or encourage collective gain in the access to interaction with other members' content? 

To answer this investigation, nine qualitative interviews of Western Europe-based artists, designers, and developers were conducted on their general online creative processes, and more specifically on the <span class="arena">Are.na</span> platform. We will gain insights into various aspects, such as tension points related to privacy, collaboration, and sharing within the creation process, and specific use cases of platforms, ranging from passive to active, and how they influence creative methods—transitioning from individual-based research toward more radical and critical models of gathering and sharing resources.

The aspects of creative processes in focus regard how interviewees, beyond their craft, practice what Nicolas Nova calls “Research-Creation”, i.e. to develop and renew knowledge through tactics, tools, observation, exploration, and combination of ideas and concepts.[^Nova] I believe the exploration online regarding the browsing, curating, and storing of references, to develop visual or literacy culture is key to investigating: which are the end goals, and to what extent interviewees exchange, collaborate, contribute, and share publicly–actively or unconsciously in their process. The interview kit helped the thesis to get insights and tension points such as topics of the intimacy of ideas, originality and legitimacy, gatekeeping, or contributing and sharing publicly.

Developing a creative’s visual culture online–as is the case offline–implies spending time and consuming content shared by others, to “absorb”, i.e. curate and collect what can fuel inspiration, and lead to new knowledge and ideas. Considering the online space as a pool of aggregated visual culture already there, why would creatives use it only one way and not contribute more actively with their self-made collections?

This MA thesis is designed as a website-first output, to shape a form meaningfully suitable to its content. Using web-to-print features (more on this process available in the [design notes](https://thesis.amauryhamon.com/#design-notes) appendice), it allows for anyone to print freely the research in A4, supporting universal access when unfortunately, most academic writings lack a broader audience due to limited online presence, enclosed access to academic platforms, and lack of PDF indexation in search results. In an echo of the aggregated platforms investigated and the digital gardening approach, this thesis was fueled by gathered references in a dedicated public <span class="arena">Are.na</span> channel[^arenathesis], and its design methodology reflects the overall topics at hand in this research, between resource-sharing and learning in public. With accessibility in mind, the web-based content allows a diversified and richer approach, including audio/video/website embeddings. This personal experiment, as a graphic designer interested in Web programming, led to the tinkering of alternative and open-source publishing and writing tools, rather than standard GUI-based corporated counterparts.
