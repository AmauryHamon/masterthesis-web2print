# Design Notes

My MA Thesis was initially designed as a website, utilizing Paged.js and PageTypeToPrint to explore the concept of single-source publishing. This approach aims to centralize content management, minimizing errors, and leveraging web technologies to present content across various media formats.

The website is adaptable for printing in pocket book format (Work in Progress) and universal A4, catering to anyone with a&nbsp;printer. For accessibility, the web-based content integrates multimedia elements such as video, audio recordings from interviews, textual transcripts, and visual content.

Additionally, this project serves as a personal experiment with alternative publishing and writing tools, diverging from standard corporate options. With a background in printed graphic design, my professional goal is to merge design with coding, moving towards a hybrid model of design and computation. I also prioritize supporting libre, open-source, and community-driven alternatives like collaborative writing pads and the paged.js library.

By harnessing web technologies like HTML's semantic markup, CSS for visual styling, and the functionalities of JS and&nbsp;PHP, Paged.js facilitated the production of both the website and&nbsp;its printed document in multiple formats.

The design of this web thesis emerged serendipitously while exploring GitHub repositories for web-to-print resources. I&nbsp;stumbled upon PageTypeToPrint, a template developed by Julien Bidoret for ESAD Pyrénées School of Art & Design Master Thesis writings. I'm grateful for this open-source tool, which provided a&nbsp;foundation for the coding architecture. It allowed me to customize the design and functionalities according to my thesis needs, despite my initial limited coding skills—skills that have hopefully improved throughout this multimedia journey. The following screenshots offers a preview of the overall workflow.
