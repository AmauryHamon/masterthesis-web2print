## Introduction

### Overview of research topic
The origin of this research topic lies in a personal interest to question how information found online is gathered, stored, and shared with others. As a designer, such informations usually take the form of visual research, text notes or technical documentation, in the end serving many different purposes: a visual moodboard to help start a project, convince a client, nurish curiosity, expand one's research. Since the birth of the World Wide Web, access to litterature, visual references has become increasingly easier, where databases were once physical such as the Mondoneum in Belgium, are now all browsable from anywhere with an access to internet. We now live in an age of information overload, where in the end, it is not so much how much knowledge we consume and store that matters, it is rather how we select, connect disparate informations and give it new meanings to formulate ideas, concepts, especially as artists, designers.

To help this endeavor of gathering knowledge, many different applications such as Tumblr, Pinterest, Are.na were born. At the intersection of knowledge networks and social media, those platforms give the possibility to work collaboratively and access other user's knowledge systems instead of going straight to the primary source. They exist and are functional thanks to the content gathered by each individuals nurishing their own space of knowledge.

From the personal blog to the digital garden

As the web was in the first place, rise of digital gardens
Urge to have one's own corner of the internet, distinct of corporation controlled web in an age of surveillance capitalism, where companies profit from users personal data through targeted advertising, behavioral manipulation. 

Individuals gathering ressources start looking for alternative models prioritizing on well-being, distraction-free, such as digital gardens. Digital garden are evolving collections of interconnected ideas, notes, and resources that are organized and shared online. It serves as a platform for personal knowledge management and allows for non-linear exploration and collaboration.

### Research Question

How using digital gardens, online platforms and networks for collaborative research and knowledge-making, helps cultivating alternative creative practices?

### Hypothesis + Significance of study
	
Digital gardening and using open-ended tools like are.na  extends an opportunity for creatives to nurture a more open & collaborative process, encouraging an alternative to streams of monetised data.

### Observation Methods

To conduct this research, qualitative interviews were made over the summer of 2023. I have been lucky to interview individually a diverse panel of artists, designers and developers on their research toolkit and usecases: between personal curation, teamwork, classroom collaboration, note-taking, client moodboards, etc.
    
Topics of discussions included to what extent their research are public, collaborative, and the impact this has on their practice.
