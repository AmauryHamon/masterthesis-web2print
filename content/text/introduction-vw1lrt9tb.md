## Introduction

The song *Remember to remember*, composed by Rick Holmes and produced by Roy Ayers, serves as a reminder to transmit the profound wisdom and invaluable lessons of past humanitarian leaders to the coming generations. While the song was released in 1981, and references public figures such as Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, among others, its chorus invitation resonates in me today.

[^holmes]: Chorus in the lyrics of Remember to remember – Rick Holmes, 1981

The chorus spreads an idea of working toward collective good, touching on the need for unity and understanding. It then helps reinforcing the importance of sharing the knowledge we can learn, collect and gather over time. This, to me, gives a sense of what the World Wide Web original principles will introduce ten years later and how it evolved until today.



The term knowledge refers in the english dictionary to the "fact or condition of knowing something with familiarity gained through experience, learning or association – by study, investigation, observation or experience". Its french translation, under the plural form, "connaissances", appears in 1595 and is described by french writer Montaigne as the "content of knowledge, all that we know.[^montaigne]" Later in the twentieth century, the plural term englobes a more precise meaning of "what we know by study, by research.[^dubos]", closer to the english definition firstly introduced. The singular counterpart "connaissance" however, introduces another layer to how we can also acquire knowledge: practice. "Action or fact to learn something by study and/or practice; result of this action or fact: skills in something, experience of something, knowledge, know-how." This definition makes most sense in a creative practice such as graphic design as expanding knowledge in this field is not only done through reading or examining visual references of past and current graphic works, it is also done by actually practicing graphic design. This implies knowledge behaves in multiple modes, such as intellect, and intuition. Philosophically speaking, another declaration from french philosopher Renan is intriguing: "Knowledge is infinity, versed in a finite mould.[^renan]". In addition, the APA Dictionary states knowledge as a range of one’s understanding or information. In some contexts the words *knowledge* and *memory* are used synonymously.[^apa]

Those two last declarations helps us to introduce how the extent of one's knowledge might be compiled and *remembered*. For someone to makes sense of all that they know, accessible knowledge is acquired by processes of selection, collection and then organisation, in order to be known. By extending one's knowledge, we somehow delimit what we know from what we do not, or have not yet learned, experienced, or practiced. In the common sense, making a collection would mean bringing together elements due to their value, attractiveness, or interestingness. According to the english dictionary, a collection is a "group of similar things that you have deliberately acquired, usually over a period of time." While I agree with evolution over time, and that to collect implies a voluntary decision, I prefer another definition stating collection as "an accumulation of objects gathered for study, comparison, or exhibition or as a hobby." This one embodies a broader sense of collecting as the gathered informations or items can be sometimes quite disparate, while sharing a few common points, or *association*. Coming back to how we defined knowledge in the first place, this is now getting interesting to see that if knowledge can be gained by association, then the act of collection clearly aims towards this end.

As Hans Ulrich Obrist states in his publication *Ways of Curating[^obrist]:*

    

> To make a collection is to find, acquire, organize and store items, whether in a room, a house, a library, a museum or a warehouse. It is also, inevitably, a way of thinking about the world – the connections and principles that produce a collection contain assumptions, juxtapositions, findings, experimental possibilities and associations. Collection-making, you could say, is a method of producing knowledge.

While Obrist focuses on physical objects relative to a practice of curation, the emphasis on the way of thinking, the connections and associations, are key also to how creatives practices collect, connect by association and grow knowledge over time to develop new skills, crafts or ideas. 



Ursula K. Le Guin in her book *Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction* (1986) brings other perspectives on the notion of collection and gathering, stating the first human tool as a basket, a tool for communion, rather than a spear, a tool for domination. It then places the protagonist in narrative structures as a gatherer rather than a hunter.[^LeGuin] To this aim, Le Guin emphasizes the significance of gathering, collecting, and sharing. This vision supports the idea of a collection working towards collective good, and asks questions about the role of the collector, and also the form of the container gathering such collections. The carrier bag, in this context, becomes a symbol of collection and preservation—a vessel for holding various elements that contribute to the sustenance and enrichment of a community. Le Guin's theory challenges the dominance of the hero's narrative and highlights the importance of collective efforts, cooperation, and the sharing of resources and knowledge.

Following on Le Guin's book, Mindy Seu expands on a contemporary approach. (imagenote: content/images/NewWomansSurvival.webp caption: New Woman's Survival Catalog) (imagenote: content/images/cyberfeminism-index.webp caption: Cyberfeminism Index) In her essay *On Gathering[^Seu]*, Seu implies that being a gatherer is an essential human activity, especially in the digital age. She defines the process of gathering to "aggregate, together with collaborators, disparate pieces from an ecosystem, and develop the appropriate container for each collection." Moreover, she explores how digital platforms and online events have transformed the way people gather and share information. Bringing different examples of collective collections, such as the *New Woman's Survival Catalog* and the *Cyberfeminism Index, *Seu explores the evolving nature of gathering, blurring the lines between container and content, and challenging the traditional notions of fixed, solitary authorship.

    

> gathering stories is radical because it refuses to give the gatherer all of the credit. The collector-collection dynamic is deliberately broken. The person who puts it together is only one of many parts.
