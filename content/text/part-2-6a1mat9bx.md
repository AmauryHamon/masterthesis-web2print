# Processes of gathering



> I use several of them on a seasonal basis, but then I have a real problem mastering this data. My problem is that I have physical sketchbooks, I use Notes quite a lot on my iPhone and then on the other side I have a pinterest folder and then a folder on Instagram and then behind that there's Arena. It's all a bit mixed up. Not to mention the InDesign documents in which I try to make pdfs and moodboards, so my use of platforms is completely chaotic. 

Lucas Erin



> I'm afraid that accumulating too many visual references is detrimental to creativity. […] When I keep something in my head, there's a part of digestion of the image, concept or idea, until it really becomes mine. As a result, I have a problem of legitimacy when I gather too much information, too many sources, too many references. I get the impression that what I'm doing looks exactly like what I'm accumulating. 

Lucas Erin



> I feel that part of my job is to go and find it. So I wonder how it's offered to me, and if it's offered to me, is it offered to everyone else? […] I like the idea of being a bookworm to find information. And the question isn't necessarily whether it's true or not, it's rather what I do with it and how I transform or use it.

Lucas Erin



> When you see the library of someone you don't know or someone who isn't there, you're making a form of judgment. 

Lucas Erin



> I've never felt the need to communicate a universe. For me, my universe is internal, it's intimate, and afterwards I convey it differently, because it's directly in the work and I don't need to use it or describe it to someone.

Lucas Erin



> There's a culture of singularity, wit, genius, talent and so on, so to have an album in which all the references are accessible, that must scare a lot of people, because it kills the idea of originality. Even if reproduction is completely assumed in all contemporary discourse in the art world, and there's nothing new anymore, it certainly remains a fantasy.  

Lucas Erin



> On Instagram you can access your likes, up to three hundred, which I find quite good for my methodology because it allows me to renew myself and not go back too far in time.

Florian Hilt



> I'm based on a notion of micro universes and on the theory of attraction and repulsion. What interests me a lot when i have access to all this content is being able to mix it together. It helps me to create projects as I'm building by association of ideas and repulsion of ideas.

Florian Hilt



> The tricky part is that it only speaks to me, it's a lot about feeling. If I show my Are.na blocks to someone else, for example, it's a bit sensitive.

Florian Hilt



> I don't see what this would bring to someone else in the sense that it would just speak to them visually or textually. For me it's really ideas put together in my head that mean something in my head.

Florian Hilt



> If I started having a public Are.na, where I collaborate with people, it would be at some point when I have a shared studio.

Florian Hilt



> Is there any point in me giving my tips on how I make certain images when in fact the result is the image? One of the funny things about photography is that sometimes I don't know how I did it, you can make images in completely chaotic and questionable conditions.

Florian Hilt



> I put some documents online, some images, I shared some stuff that's pretty hard to find on the internet. I put them in public so that people could have access to them.

Florian Hilt



> There are times when I go back to Pinterest because I need to start with an image and try to open up the field as much as possible and I'm offered a ton of images.

Aurélie Vial



> I compile moodboards to convince clients to go in one direction or another. For me, visual inspiration is not just references but also means to convince my customers.

Aurélie Vial



> There's a Tumblr I think I've been going to for ten years. because it's a source that's reliable for me. It's still nurtured and active. And the quality of the image compilation is pretty constant. I mean, it's never disappointed me. 

Aurélie Vial



> I don't know if it's a personal choice or if it just happened, but I'm not at all a participative person, I don't have social networks. Except Are.na, where sometimes I add things. I don't just take blocks, part of what I add is images I've taken from sites, from Google, from Pinterest. But I also, and this happens quite often, scan things from books or other sources and add them to Arena. In fact, I feed a bit of content. 

Aurélie Vial



> If someone had access to this content, it would be an access to the whole way in which you develop your visual culture and therefore also a part of your work. But at the same time, it's never so much a secret, because I really do use visual references, and I often show them to my clients.

Aurélie Vial



> It's pretty hard to know what the real purpose of the people who created these platforms is, I've never looked. There must be instructions for use, I don't know. I've never thought about it. I just intuitively did what was most useful for me. 

Aurélie Vial



> The arrival of mass images on the Internet has changed everything. But it's a double-edged sword because, you can get completely lost in it too. 

Aurélie Vial



> I spent a lot of time extracting images from these databases on Pinterest. There's extremely little referencing of images, there are no captions. I do the work of looking up where these images come from. Sometimes it leads you to other images.

Aurélie Vial



> On Arena, everything is set up so that you caption your images and source them. Whereas on Pinterest, you feel that it's a mass thing, and then the images, they come back all the time. That's why I don't use Pinterest when it's really about looking at these images and feeding yourself with something, because it scrambles my brain.

Aurélie Vial



> On these sites where you archive things, I can see how my ability to search for images has evolved, and I think it's actually an important skill in my work. Not everyone can do good image research. And so, I have the impression that there's a part of it where you have to preserve it from the outside because it's a job. And not everyone has the same ability to do good reference research and to be well referenced.

Aurélie Vial



> I think it's part of your quality as a designer, to do image research well, to be very well referenced and to know how to open up the scope. There's a part where it's almost a kind of professional secret.

Aurélie Vial



> In a job interview, you can almost sell it by saying "I'm coming with my reference books, and my reference books are really good."

Aurélie Vial



> I have certain things that remain public and I like to keep them public. I have this channel of Swiss logos that I find quite funny, it's even open to contribute. And some things… it's not about keeping it to myself or having a private collection, it's rather I didn't really go back over it. I think that before publishing something, I tend to want to go over it myself, to see what I'm sharing.

Frederik Mahler-Andersen



> Personally, I like to share what I find. But on platforms like Are.na or others, I'm much more restrictive, and I don't really know why, but I think it's the oral sharing that attracts me more.

Frederik Mahler-Andersen



> With the Internet, with so much content, so many things to look at, you can get lost on Github, you can get lost in Arena, you can get lost on YouTube... You have this black hole where you have too much information and I think what I appreciate a lot is when it's something sharp that's shared with a purpose.

Frederik Mahler-Andersen



> Are.na, for example, is a small community. There are a lot of people who share a lot of things, with a lot of good will, which is great. But there are also a lot of people who have so many private things, I imagine. It's a bit restrictive. But I think the code is the same, maybe a little more participative.

Frederik Mahler-Andersen



> I feel pretty guilty because that's what I did in the beginning too, looking for stuff in the source code. And that's what taught me how to do a lot of things. And in the end, you want to give something back that's been useful to you. It's like with P2P downloading, there are seeders and leechers, and I think I'm more of a seeder than a leecher unfortunately, but I'd like to change my ratio.

Frederik Mahler-Andersen



> I stopped teaching precisely because I wanted to have more time to do research, to do things that wouldn't necessarily end up in a project or a mandate, but which could be open source code or plugins. I've done several of them, but they're not ready yet, or I never thought of publishing them while I was doing them.

Frederik Mahler-Andersen



> Are.na is also sometimes the same phenomenon as Instagram, it can be a bit "death scrolling" when you follow too many people. It starts to snowball, and then you lose track a bit.

Frederik Mahler-Andersen



> For me, as a web designer, when I see too many websites, they're all a bit custom-made. All with graphics that are a bit too much, then I get lost. The people I follow on Are.na, apart from certain artists etc., are a lot of people who do the same thing as me. So you end up in a spiral where you also see their references and make them your own.

Frederik Mahler-Andersen



> On a commercial level, the stakes for someone who's a developer/graphic designer are different. If someone were to steal that, you're so much into github code sharing that the notion of copyright is less present. I'm not at all afraid of someone stealing my references.

Frederik Mahler-Andersen



> Books sometimes inspire me more than platforms; I rather use platforms to store references.

Emilie Pillet



> I'm going to try to find things in a more organic way, because I have the impression that on these platforms, there are a lot of people reposting and as time goes by, the content becomes very polished and you can't find anything out of the ordinary.
