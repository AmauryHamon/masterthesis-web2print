# Conclusion

In conclusion, the exploration of how creatives gather and share ressources within the broader landscape of private UGC and UGCCCC platforms, with Are.na as a case study has revealed both appealing & unique attributes and the tensions inherent to research and creation through such platforms. Are.na, while remaining a walled garden, distinguishes itself by offering the creative community a mindful space for curation, context and collaboration, bringing commitment to user privacy and without the common passive features of mainstream social media. Its high quality curated content and collaborative features allow enhanced development of creatives’ visual culture.

Yet, different profiles emerged from my interviews with creatives, and shed light on concerns and challenges to using those platforms. The beneficial enhanced access to inspiration with widespread visual culture leads simultaneously to potential over-consumption of decontextualized and homogenized visual culture as collective patterns or social bubbles. The balance between radical shared ownership of gathering and public sharing while preserving the intimacy of one's research emerges as a significant challenge, with diverse perspectives on the economic value of creative research online.

Fully gatekeeping one’s private research and online gatherings can initially be reminiscent of the overall climate of competition within creative and research fields, nurturing scarcity instead of abundance models tended through curating publicly, contributing and sharing ressources to the creative community. This collaborative commoning approach to gathering and sharing within the creative community is critical to pivot default competition into better collaboration.

Through its steady growth, Are.na fostered a community of creative gatherers. The platform's design encourages a more open, thoughtful and engaged approach to gathering in the digital age, through sharing ownership, bringing context, content curation, fostering a unique sense of community among its members. Intersecting creativity and technology, these collaborative curation platforms continue to shape and reflect online culture, the examination of specific cases like Are.na or digital gardens contributes to our understanding of the dynamics at play in fueling creativity within the digital realm. The case of Are.na used by creatives demonstrates the complexities and intricacies inherent in UGC platforms, offering valuable insights into the evolving landscape of digital collaboration, content curation, and contextualization of the web drowned by algorithms and centralized private platforms.

Digital gardens, while not actively practiced by my interviewees, offer a radical approach and comeback to the early personal vernacular web, which creative gathering and sharing could use. Decentring individual genius and expert as ever-learning apprentice, removing the pressure of formal modes of final state gatherings, compiled in blog articles or essays.
