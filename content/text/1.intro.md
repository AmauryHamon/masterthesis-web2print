- changes in various fields, including art, design, and development
    - before the web: libraries, design bookshops with limited access to transcontinental references/translations.
    - Since the birth of the World Wide Web, access to litterature, visual references has become increasingly easier,
    - To help this endeavor of gathering knowledge, many different applications such as Tumblr, Pinterest, Are.na were born. At the intersection of knowledge networks and social media, those platforms give the possibility to work collaboratively and access each other user's knowledge systems (if public) there considerably improving the speed to discover new inputs.
    - As a designer, such processes of research usually take the form of image selections, text notes or technical documentation, in the end serving many different purposes: a visual moodboard to help start a project, convince a client, nurish curiosity, expand one's research. 
        
>To make a collection is to find, acquire, organize and store items, whether in a room, a house, a library, a museum or a warehouse. It is also, inevitably, a way of thinking about the world – the connections and principles that produce a collection contain assumptions, juxtapositions, findings, experimental possibilities and associations. Collection-making, you could say, is a method of producing knowledge [^obrist].

- relevance of the thesis subject now? Today's internet:  
    With the evolution of the world wide web from its hypertext origins to a more social web, access to knowledge and means to develop one's visual culture have significantly improved, yet the more content is available, the more chance there is to get lost in information overload. Digital gardening and using open-ended tools like are.na extends an opportunity for creatives to nurture a more open & collaborative process, encouraging an alternative to streams of monetised data.
    

    - information overload: We now live in an age of information overload, where in the end, it is not so much how much knowledge we consume and store that matters, it is rather how we select, connect disparate informations and give it new meanings to formulate ideas, concepts, especially as artists, designers.
        >In the age of information overload, the ultimate luxury is meaning and context. [^Rossetto]

    [^Rossetto]: Louis Rossetto, Wired Manifesto, 1993.

    - social media fatigue
    - context collapse
    - attention economy
    - surveillance capitalism: Urge to have one's own corner of the internet, distinct of corporation controlled web in an age of surveillance capitalism, where companies profit from users personal data through targeted advertising, behavioral manipulation. 
    - web3, decentralized internet?
    - commons and models of abundance of ressources instead of scarcity

###  Online Collaborative Research Tools

- overview of the diverse range of online collaborative research tools used by creative individuals and teams. 
- list varied forms, (social media platforms, cloud-based document sharing, and collaborative coding repositories…) 
- Those online tools are of all sorts: social medias (Instagram, X), blogs (Tumblr), image classifiers (Pinterest, Are.na), notepads (Obsidian, Notes, Notion), stylesheets (Google Sheet).
- those tools are central to the creative processes being studied: In their endeavor of collecting, organizing and showing corpus of references, for personal curation, client meetings, pedagogical approaches or else,

###  On digital gardening
Individuals gathering ressources start looking for alternative models prioritizing on well-being, distraction-free, such as digital gardens. Digital garden are evolving collections of interconnected ideas, notes, and resources that are organized and shared online. It serves as a platform for personal knowledge management and allows for non-linear exploration and collaboration.

### Research objectives + question + methods

- objectives:
- question: How using digital gardens, online knowledge networks and collaborative visual research platforms, can influence alternative creative practices
- methods: 
    - Litterature Review
    - Case Studies/UI Studies
    - Interviews with artists & designers
To conduct this research, qualitative interviews were made over the summer of 2023. I have been lucky to interview individually a diverse panel of artists, designers and developers on their research toolkit and usecases: between personal curation, teamwork, classroom collaboration, note-taking, client moodboards, etc.
- introduce 9 interviewees
    
Topics of discussions included to what extent their research are public, collaborative, and the impact this has on their practice. 
- introduce tension points
