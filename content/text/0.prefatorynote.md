# Abstract

This thesis delves into the impact of online User-Generated Content (UGC) platforms (e.g. Are.na), and "digital gardening" on the research and practice of interviewed creatives. It explores how initial ideas, often cultivated privately, evolve and expand into public sharing. These platforms, acting as personal or communal gardens, foster "public" growth through collaborative features, not always used among practitioners. The study examines whether these platforms serve as catalysts for creative exploration and production, highlighting the transformative potential to shift individualist processes into models of collaborative commons.
