## Interview: Lucas Erin

Franco-Caribbean artist based in Lausanne, Lucas Erin has developed his practice based on multicultural thinking open to an aesthetic of inter-humanity, encounter, proximity and resistance to social formatting. His *sentimenthèque* project - directly inspired by the thinking of writer Patrick Chamoiseau and philosopher Edouard Glissant's concept of *créolité* - is based on a cultural heritage linked to the theme of catastrophe in the Caribbean. Open, poetic and duly referenced, his artistic approach is firmly rooted in contemporaneity.

This interview was done through videocall and recorded in August 30th, 2023.
