>To make a collection is to find, acquire, organize and store items, whether in a room, a house, a library, a museum or a warehouse. It is also, inevitably, a way of thinking about the world â€“ the connections and principles that produce a collection contain assumptions, juxtapositions, findings, experimental possibilities and associations. Collection-making, you could say, is a method of producing knowledge [^obrist].

[^obrist]: Hans Ulrich Obrist - Ways of Curating

>In the age of information overload, the ultimate luxury is meaning and context. [^Rossetto]

[^Rossetto]: Louis Rossetto, Wired Manifesto, 1993.
