# Introduction

This master's thesis delves into the transformative influence of online collaborative platforms on the creative research and practice of interviewed artists, designers, and developers. With their use of private user-generated content (UGC) platforms – such as Tumblr, Pinterest, Are.na, etc. – and more public niche practice of _digital gardening_, understanding how creative research is conducted (through documentation, curation,  contextualization, collection-making, collaboration, ressource-sharing and) is paramount. While the seed for a creative research or production can usually start small and private, it grows over time before eventually being shared in public, in which it is interesting to analyze the threshold between those states. Through those platforms as personal or community gardens, both research and practice of creative practitioners could be tremendously scaled up by growing publicly and working collaboratively.

Nowadays, thanks to advances in algorithms, hardware miniaturization, wireless connectivity and increased data storage, most of the UGC platforms sits as private data silos within a corporated side of the World Wide Web ecosystem, centralized by GAFAM (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft etc.). “The entire body of a social media platform is meant to keep users within the walled garden consuming content.”[^Knopf] While UGC services and networks promotes a sense of questionable _public_ digital space for humans to connect, those interactions and content remain detained behind walls, limiting access through user-consent of one’s data or pay-to-enter models. According to Jenny Odell:[^Odell]

> A public, noncommercial space demands nothing from you in order for you to enter, nor for you to stay; the most obvious difference between public space and other spaces is that you don't have to buy anything, or pretend to buy something, to be there.

Out of this context, individually-scaled handmade and public uses of the web emerges, reminiscent of the Web’s early vernacular days. A _garden_ draws a  sense of public view and access. Commonly defined as a “a rich-well cultivated region” where things are “cultivated”, they can be displayed “[…] so that the public can go and see them [plants and flowers].” 

_Digital garden _then_, _another to the list in nature-inspired terms to describe technological actions and methods, is a neologism dating from the nineties via _Hypertext Garden_, a website by Mark Bernstein (1998). Re-emerged in 2015 by Mike Caulfield’s conference _The Garden and the Stream, a Technopastoral_, Caulfield underlined the need to reclaim independent ownership from the corporated Web platforms and social media, by setting up a personal yet public digital space of knowledge curation on the Web, for content to be de-streamed from algorithmic feeds and cultivated over time. 

The platforms mentionned reveal attributes interesting to evaluate. In a 2019 conference[^platformattr], Are.na Co-founder Charles Broskoski developed on the following attributes: Do platforms encourage active or passive use, regarding aspects of cognitive load? Liking an image is not the same as connecting it into a folder defined by the user. Is the platform open-ended or restrictive for how one can use it? What is the focus or purpose of the platform? The scale and diversity of population of the platform is also highly linked to what content is generated on it. To what extent the platform gives a sense of ownership to its population in order to steer the direction of the platform? What is the method of communication between members on the platform? Is it considered introverted, with minimal features or extraverted with full multimedia communications? In this sense, does the platform allows meaningful ways to be alone on it? Last but not least, does the platforms target individual gain or encourage collective gain in the access to interaction with other members content?

Therefore, the research question I endeavor to answer is therefore: \
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">&lt;u>How using online knowledge networks and collaborative user aggregated platforms can help influence or cultivate alternative creative practices?&lt;/u> </span>

To answer this investigation, qualitative interviews of western Europe-based artists, designers and developers were conducted on their general online creative research processes, and more specifically on the Are.na (2012) platform. We will gain insights into specific use cases and the yet to illucidate transformative potential (or tension points) of these platforms on creative research and production, shifting individual-based research towards radical and critical gathering and ressource-sharing models.

The aspects of creative research in focus regards how interviewees browse, curate, store references, to which end goal, and to what extent they collaborate, contribute and share publicly – actively or unconsciously in their process. The interview kit helped the research to get insights and tension points such as topics of the intimacy of ideas, originality and legitimacy, gatekeeping or contributing and sharing publicly. Moreover, does the tool shape the creative’s workflow, or vice-versa?

Ursula K. Le Guin in her book *Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction* (1986) brings perspectives on the notion of collection and gathering, stating the first human tool as a basket, a tool for communion, rather than a spear, a tool for domination. It then places the protagonist in narrative structures as a gatherer rather than a hunter.[^LeGuin] To this aim, Le Guin emphasizes the significance of gathering, collecting, and sharing. This vision supports the idea of a collection working towards collective good expressed by Daniel and asks questions about the role of the collector, and also the form of the container gathering such collections. The carrier bag, in this context, becomes a symbol of collection and preservation—a vessel for holding various elements that contribute to the sustenance and enrichment of a community. Le Guin's theory challenges the dominance of the hero's narrative and highlights the importance of collective efforts, cooperation, and the sharing of resources and knowledge.

This research is designed as a website-first output, in order to shape a form meaningfully suitable to its content. Using web-to-print features (more on this process available in the [design notes](LINK) appendice), it allows for anyone to print freely the research in A4, supporting universal access when unfortunately, most academic writings lack a broader audience through limited online presence, enclosed access to academic platforms, and lack of PDF indexation in search results. In echo of the platforms investigated and digital gardening approach, this research was fueled of gathered references in a dedicated public Are.na channel[^arenathesis], and its design methodology reflects the overall topics at hand in this research, between public ressource-sharing and learning. With accessibility in mind, the web-based content allows a richer approach than text and images, including audio/video/website embeddings. This personal experiment, as a graphic designer interested in web programming, led to the tinkering of alternative publishing and writing tools, rather than standard GUI-based corporated counterparts.

The first part of this research is dedicated to online gathering and sharing as creative processes, introduced by interviewees’ use cases of UGC platforms and evolution of those services.
