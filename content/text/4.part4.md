In this last chapter, we will analyze digital gardens as a public individual alternatives to <span class="arena">Are.na</span> and the likes (i.e. private, gatekeeper-bounded spaces of the internet), defined by Venkatesh Rao as the _Cozy Web[^CozyWeb]_. While <span class="arena">Are.na</span> is often compared by its members and some of my interviewees as a knowledge network of digital gardens for creatives, its full access to features and contents remains restricted via a paid community membership. Envisioning the current state of the Web as a majoritarily privatized ecosystem of walled gardens, fueled with massive information highways platforms, digital gardens stands as a public handmade alternative lying beyond the walled gardens.

## 4.1 Trailing origins of the term

Digital gardening, i.e. planting _seeds_ and cultivating knowledge, seem to follow a trail implicating the vocabulary of nature to details technological endeavors. Other common metaphors include indexing our files on our devices as a _forest_ of _branching_ directories originating from a _root_ folder. Speaking of _bugs_ and _viruses_ or _worms_ about programming errors and potential digital attacks. Using the _Cloud_ as a _fog_ of data. Surfing on the web, navigating the X (Twitter) _stream_, downloading _torrents_ of media. 

The term appeared in Mark Bernstein’s 1998 _Hypertext Garden_[^Hypertextgardens], among early Hypertext (1965) experiments implemented in the World Wide Web. The hypertext essay featured metaphorically topics on free internet exploration within gardens and wilderness. While being less centered on building personal digital spaces, it emphasized the experience flows and how web contents could be organized.

Current understanding of the term appeared in 2015 through the Stanford conference[^CaulfieldConf] and essay[^CaulfieldEssay] of Mike Caulfield, _The Garden and the Stream: a Technopastoral._ Caulfield implies digital gardening is not about using specific technologies but rather how to rethink our online behavior towards information, through personal and explorable online space. As our web navigation progressively delved into  _streams_ of collapsed information into single-track timelines of events–from social media feeds and chats–lifespan of information is limited and not designed to be accumulated and grow over time as implies Gemma Copeland:

[^CaulfieldConf]: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckv_CjyKyZY&feature=emb_logo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckv_CjyKyZY&feature=emb_logo)

> It's about not trying to use things that are always distracting you and also building that kind of collective knowledge base over time. WhatsApp or Slack, everything gets lost into the stream. You're not actually building anything long term, you're just kind of chatting and it's chaotic, etc. 
> <span>–Gemma Copeland</span>

For Design Researcher Maggie Appleton, Digital Gardens, similarly to Wikipedia’s **wiki** architecture, embrace Hypertext as a “richly linked landscape that grows slowly over time.”[^Appleton] This allows to consider Digital Gardens as **contextual knowledge** containers, emancipating from time-bound streams and walled gardens of UGC platforms.

A few years later, following Caulfield’s perspectives, a community of writers, developers invested and expanded the understanding of the term which helped emphasize its distinctive aspects and motivations compared to other typologies of web spaces. This context also marked the emergence of contemporary Productivity softwares, especially Personal Knowledge Management (PKB) Systems such as Obsidian (2020) or Roam (2019) mentionned by my interviewees.

Tom Chritchlow’s 2018, _Of Digital Streams, Campfires and Gardens[^Campfires]_ suggested the addition of _campfires_ between streams and gardens as collective _cozy web_ spaces for exchanges of not **fully formed** yet knowledge, underlining digital gardens as rather individual counterparts. Joel Hooks’ _My blog is a digital garden, not a blog[^hooks]_ implied gardens as distinctive from blogs, emphasizing the inherent **slow growth** of ideas through writing, rewriting, editing, and revising thoughts in **public**. Amy Hoy’s _How the Blog Broke the Web_[^Hoy], retraces a historical context of blogs and arrival of standardized web layouts through templating, which to her _killed_ the radical **handmade** web approach, and emphasized the reccurent structure of reversed chronology ordered of blog contents, which differs from the **topological** and **networked thoughts** architecture of digital gardens.

In early 2020, developper Shaun Wang’s _Digital Garden Terms of Service[^wang]_ offered a compilation of digital garden ethos, while researcher Anne-Laure Le Cunff’s published a guide[^lecunff] to build your own digital garden. The same year, Tanya Basu writes for MIT Technology Review an article[^mittr] about this emergent practice.

While digital gardening was firstly output by developers with coding skills, it soon drew attention of plenty of writers, researchers, and note-taking enthusiasts, while the growing communities of PKB practitioners and advances in web development allowed more and more gardeners to join the movement. Web technologies like Vercel (2015) or Netlify (2014) and static-site-generators (publishing webpages out of plain text files) helped to keep pain out of development and focus on seeds of content, while proprietary platforms like Roam, TiddlyWiki (2004), Notion (2018) and Obsidian (2020) progressively proposed no-code alternatives to publish digital gardens online, yet limiting its users to standardized layouts.


## 4.2 Digital gardens: not just a blog

Digital gardens, unlike traditional blogs, eschew the chronological confines of a timeline and instead emphasize contextual relationships and associative links. In there, as the following examples I provided in this public <span class="arena">Are.na</span> channel[^arenagarden], the structure isn't tethered to dates; rather, it thrives on interconnections between posts based on themes, topics, and shared contexts. Maggie Appleton aptly describes these gardens as having “many points of entry but no defined pathways.”

[^arenagarden]: [https://www.<span class="arena">Are.na</span>/amaury-hamon/digital-gardeners](https://www.<span class="arena">Are.na</span>/amaury-hamon/digital-gardeners) 

This **topology** over a timeline allows readers to traverse content via bi-directional linking, thematic piles[^piles], nested folders[^folders], tags[^tags], advanced search bars, and visual node graphs[^graphview], creating a non-linear, explorative experience, while questionning the established norms of a _personal website_ in a playful way.

**Continuous growth** is fundamental to digital gardens. Unlike formal articles or essays, these spaces evolve perpetually. Emphasizing editability, there's no notion of a final version—ideas are seeded, nurtured, and continuously tended, allowing for feedback, revision, and expansion. This fosters a low-pressure environment, promoting the organic evolution of thoughts and ideas over time, offering readers insights into the author's thinking process and embracing imperfection and growth.

The essence of **learning in public** is central to digital gardening, encouraging sharing and learning during the learning process, not as an _expert_ or _individual genius_ retrospectively. Digital gardening is the _Domestic Cozy_ response to the professional personal blog, both intimate and public, weird and welcoming. Responsibility is integral; notes can be categorized metaphorically as _seedlings_, _budding_, or _evergreen_, signifying their development stage. Gwern.net[^gwern] exemplifies this with meta-reflections on each entry, including topic tags, dates, stage tags, certainty levels, and importance rankings.

These gardens challenge the norms of personal websites, aiming for **deep contextualization** amidst the chaos of the internet. They emphasize **content diversity**, welcoming various formats like podcasts, videos, illustrations, tweets, and academic papers, fostering a rich multimedia environment.

Independently owning a digital garden is pivotal; it ensures control and **ownership**, diverging from walled gardens and platforms like Facebook or Twitter. None of these platforms are designed to help you slowly build and weave personal knowledge. Most of them actively fight against it. Additionally, as Daniel states, “technologies come and go, no matter how powerful or stable they seem to be”, your writing and creations can sink with it. None of them have an easy export button. And they certainly won't hand you your data in a transferable format.

While currently **solitary** endeavors, efforts are underway to create multiplayer spaces. _Webmentions_[^webmentions] are an option to gather a community of personal websites.

[^webmentions]: [https://webmention.io/](https://webmention.io/)

In essence, digital gardens symbolize a shift towards a more intentional, less performative, yet engaging and personalized approach to sharing knowledge. They encapsulate the dichotomy between chaos and **cultivation**, embracing **imperfection**, continuous growth, and responsible sharing in a multimedia-rich, non-linear environment—all while securing ownership and control within the vast expanse of the internet.


## 4.3  A personal experiment 

Simultaneously to the writing of this thesis, in order to better understand the possibilities of digital gardening, I experimented since summer 2023 with the creation and customization of my own digital garden[^gardenself], using researcher Jacky Zhao’s _Quartz_[^quartz] Digital Garden Static Site Generator (SSG). With Laurel Schwulst’s 2018 essay on how websites could be[^schwulst] and J.R. Carpenter’s 2015 essay _A Handmade Web_[^carpenter] in mind, my personal motivation was not only to address hands on the topic of this research but develop a public learning space as a network of interconnected ideas and thoughts, growing over time, and to resist _wysiwyg_ templates and enclosed platforms. Exploring communal technology through Replit and his own independent research, Jacky Zhao’s quotes on his own digital garden: 

> How might we create infrastructures and technologies that empower the residents of the web to have access to the same tools as the architect?

(figure: content/images/gardenselfnodes.png caption: Nodal graph view of the gathered ressources since inception)

Developed for my own educational purposes to teach introduction to web programming for graphic design students, Quartz is indeed used by thousands of students, teachers and developers. Zhao created his own community of contributors and users of his technology, by open-sourcing the project and including a Discord channel for anyone to showcase their digital gardens and take part in contributing or requesting additional plugins.

Having such a personal container for my gathered knowledge feels less centered on gathering visual culture, which I would rather host on my already crowded public <span class="arena">Are.na</span> channels, but more on note-taking markdown files in public, to immediately share outside walled garden educational ressources about design and code.

Features from Quartz allowed my digital garden to structure content non-linearily and in a rhizomatic way, by contextualizing each node of information to others. Using a powerful search engine, bi-directional linkings (where a linked page also show a reverse link to where it is quoted), and a graph node view reminiscent from Obsidian UI, the architecture emphasizes hypertext exploration while also allowing linear features: a file explorer for folder view, a recent notes for reverse-chronological view, tags and index pages to list content related to common topics.
