# Gathering

## definitions Gathering + creative reserach

* (to gather: to bring together)
* to pick up or amass as if by harvesting, the collecting of food or raw materials from the wild
* creative research : Creative research is creative production that produces new knowledge through an interrogation/disruption of form vs. creative production that refines existing knowledge through an adaptation of convention. It is often characterized by innovation, sustained collaboration and inter/trans-disciplinary or hybrid praxis, challenging conventional rubrics of evaluation and assessment within traditional academic environments.

## The Web as containers of creative knowledge

Ursula K. Le Guin in her book *Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction* (1986) brings other perspectives on the notion of collection and gathering, stating the first human tool as a basket, a tool for communion, rather than a spear, a tool for domination. It then places the protagonist in narrative structures as a gatherer rather than a hunter.[^LeGuin] To this aim, Le Guin emphasizes the significance of gathering, collecting, and sharing. This vision supports the idea of a collection working towards collective good and asks questions about the role of the collector, and also the form of the container gathering such collections. The carrier bag, in this context, becomes a symbol of collection and preservation—a vessel for holding various elements that contribute to the sustenance and enrichment of a community. Le Guin's theory challenges the dominance of the hero's narrative and highlights the importance of collective efforts, cooperation, and the sharing of resources and knowledge.

Following Le Guin's book, Mindy Seu expands on a contemporary approach. In her essay *On Gathering*[^Seu], Seu implies that being a gatherer is an essential human activity, especially in the digital age. She defines the process of gathering to "aggregate, together with collaborators, disparate pieces from an ecosystem, and develop the appropriate container for each collection." Moreover, she explores how digital platforms and online events have transformed the way people gather and share information. Bringing different examples of collective collections, such as the *New Woman's Survival Catalog* (imagenote: content/images/NewWomansSurvival.webp caption: New Woman's Survival Catalog) and the *Cyberfeminism Index*, (imagenote: content/images/cyberfeminism-index.webp caption: Cyberfeminism Index) Seu explores the evolving nature of gathering, blurring the lines between container and content, and challenging the traditional notions of fixed, solitary authorship.

> Gathering stories is radical because it refuses to give the gatherer all of the credit. The collector-collection dynamic is deliberately broken. The person who puts it together is only one of many parts.

> In the age of information overload, the ultimate luxury is meaning and context.[^Rossetto]

[^Rossetto]: Louis Rossetto, Wired Manifesto, 1993.

> With the Internet, with so much content, so many things to look at, you can get lost on Github, you can get lost in Arena, you can get lost on YouTube... You have this black hole where you have too much information and I think what I appreciate a lot is when it's something sharp that's shared with a purpose.

Frederik Mahler-Andersen

> The arrival of mass images on the Internet has changed everything. But it's a double-edged sword because, you can get completely lost in it too. 

Aurélie Vial

> I'm based on a notion of micro universes and on the theory of attraction and repulsion. What interests me a lot when i have access to all this content is being able to mix it together. It helps me to create projects as I'm building by association of ideas and repulsion of ideas.

## Tools of the trade: What platforms are used and how by interviewed creatives? What is their underlying motivations or goals?



1. introduce method and casting of interviews

	To conduct this research, qualitative interviews were made over the summer of 2023. I have been lucky to interview individually a diverse panel of artists, designers and developers on their research toolkit and usecases: between personal curation, teamwork, classroom collaboration, note-taking, client moodboards, etc.

- introduce 9 interviewees



2. quotes interviews and list tools

> There are times when I go back to Pinterest because I need to start with an image and try to open up the field as much as possible and I'm offered a ton of images.

Aurélie Vial

> I do it just for myself, to have like a record of how things change. I was thinking, when you have a very long career, you look five years behind, and then you're like, oh my god, I'm so bad, or my style was so shitty, but then it's cool, you see the growth, you see the progress, and it makes you reflect

Daniel Robert Prieto

> I don't do it with a goal. I just do it because I have a stupid impulse of collecting shit and organizing stuff in two pockets. I don't have a research system. I just look for the stuff. I pick what is beautiful and what's interesting. 

Daniel Robert Prieto

> It's pretty hard to know what the real purpose of the people who created these platforms is, I've never looked. There must be instructions for use, I don't know. I've never thought about it. I just intuitively did what was most useful for me. 

Aurélie Vial

> Tumblr. Why do I like it? Because it's just one big stream of images, so it's so simple. And there are tools for downloading the whole of Tumblr. You know why I like to use Arena? Because you can take a hundred images and drag them up on the screen. And it works. You need tools that are stupid, simple in the sense that they're, they're incredibly reliable.

Daniel Robert Prieto

> For Common Knowledge we use so many tools. Over the last couple of years, more spread out from wanting this kind of Like big monolithic tool that does everything. This kind of generalist approach of trying to be this all in one thing is actually not the best because it doesn't do anything well. Tools that do one thing well, but are interoperable with other tools, I think that for me, that's the kind of gold standards. We really like tools that are quite opinionated, particularly those that are not about trying to get your attention all the time. So, for example, we don't use Slack.

Gemma Copeland

> I would never use Pinterest, for example, to look for references.  I have the impression that with all the platforms, it sends back the same references, the same aesthetics. 

Emilie Pillet

> On Instagram you can access your likes, up to three hundred, which I find quite good for my methodology because it allows me to renew myself and not go back too far in time.

Florian Hilt

> I record a lot of references.  It's a lot easier to create this sort of local library on my computer and remember where things are than an online platform where I'll quickly forget what I've seen.

Emilie Pillet

> I compile moodboards to convince clients to go in one direction or another. For me, visual inspiration is not just references but also means to convince my clients.

Aurélie Vial

> Books sometimes inspire me more than platforms; I rather use platforms to store references.

Emilie Pillet

> I use several of them on a _seasonal_ basis, but then I have a real problem mastering this data. My problem is that I have physical sketchbooks, I use Notes quite a lot on my iPhone and then on the other side I have a Pinterest folder and then a folder on Instagram and then behind that there's Arena. It's all a bit mixed up. Not to mention the InDesign documents in which I try to make pdfs and moodboards, so my use of platforms is completely chaotic. 

Lucas Erin

> In my personal practice or, as I'm working on common knowledge projects, it's mainly, arena for references and then obsidian obsidian for like note taking, which is also I guess like a digital garden.

Gemma Copeland

> There's a Tumblr I think I've been going to for ten years. because it's a source that's reliable for me. It's still nurtured and active. And the quality of the image compilation is pretty constant. I mean, it's never disappointed me. 

Aurélie Vial

> The reason why I was using Tumblr was like the shortcuts. Because I could go with J and K. I think K was to save it, and I could go like, very quick, yeah, because like, I cannot go with mouse, like I go too fast,

Daniel Robert Prieto

> I spent a lot of time extracting images from these databases on Pinterest. There's extremely little referencing of images, there are no captions. I do the work of looking up where these images come from. Sometimes it leads you to other images.

## Sharing is caring – on collaborative research

How can we leverage the power of the web to shift towards a better sharing of the resources online?



* Collaboration versus Competition
* From Scarcity to Abundance: collaborative digital commons

> I stopped teaching precisely because I wanted to have more time to do research, to do things that wouldn't necessarily end up in a project or a mandate, but which could be open source code or plugins. I've done several of them, but they're not ready yet, or I never thought of publishing them while I was doing them.

Frederik Mahler-Andersen

> If the whole culture of design is about some people getting to be famous and well respected, and a bunch of other people don't get recognized, don't get paid well, et cetera. It just creates this whole climate of competition and that we're all trying to fight against each other for scarce resources, whereas I think this kind of approach of like the commons and open source and collectivity means that you create this kind of shared abundance, where you can all get something and be happy and like enjoy your work, etc. And you're not trying to fight each other. 

Gemma Copeland

> It just all boils down to my inherent hatred of individualism and ownership. With Common Knowledge, all these things I'm interested in, it's about shared ownership and creating a commons and recognizing that we're not individuals, we're part of a network where we contain communities.
