## Introduction



The song *Remember to remember*, composed by Rick Holmes and produced by Roy Ayers, serves as a reminder to transmit the profound wisdom and invaluable lessons of past humanitarian leaders to the coming generations. While the song was released in 1981, and references public figures such as Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, among others, its chorus invitation resonates in me today: 



> Pass the information, Extend the Knowledge[^holmes]

The chorus spreads an idea of working toward collective good, touching on the need for unity and understanding. It then helps reinforcing the importance of sharing the knowledge we can learn, collect and gather over time. This, to me, gives a sense of what the World Wide Web original principles will introduce ten years later and how it evolved until today. The spread of the Internet caused a sudden leap in access to and ability to share information, where the amount of digital data stored growed exponentially.



Created in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN, the now commonly called Web was released to the public in 1991, with the underlying motivations to pool ressources and help the storing, updating, and finding of informations. As stated on the CERN website, the Web was originally conceived and developed to meet the demand for automated information-sharing between scientists in universities and institutes around the world. [^BernersLee] Using Ted Nelson's Hypertext model, navigating in nonlinear ways through disparate documents with hyperlinks has tremendously helped to build a global collection of knowledge hosted on websites and databases, all accessible on interconnected computers. This key technology of the Information Age, using global networks of computers has grown from a few thousands of websites in the early nineties to over 1.5 billion of websites today. Browsing the Web – meaning to jump from one webpage to another using hyperlinks – has drawn different ways of interacting with information online: one of them being exploratory surfing. In the nineties, before the Web evolved to its social aspects nowadays, it was initially a more *read-only* approach. Users would then essentially *surf* the web in a passive manner to explore pages without really editing it or appending content. To facilitate the access of online informations, the rise of search engines such as Google and Yahoo helped users in their search, in addition to more human actions such as bookmarking webpages. In the new millenium arrived what was called the Web 2.0 – the social Web. Static websites turned more interactive, making the editing and contributing much easier for people to interact and collaborate with each other. With this in mind, content aggregation platforms such as news and social media (Facebook, X, Instagram, Youtube, Flickr, etc.), forums, blogs or wikis (more on those later) started to receive content from users and build virtual communities. With those new platforms, users could then connect with friends and family, share texts, images and videos as well as opinions on a vast range of topics. To follow-up on this file authorization metaphore, the Web essentially became a *read-write* model, which in essence is closer to what Tim Berners-Lee's original vision was:

    

> A collaborative medium, a place where we [could] all meet and read and write. [^BernersLee]



[^BernersLee]: ** **LAWSON,** **Mark, *Berners-Lee on the read/write web*, BBC News [online], 9 August 2005, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4132752.stm](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4132752.stm) [consulted: 16 October 2023]



The Web 2.0 also gave birth to new models of business with the rise of online advertising and eshops, permitting companies to generate revenues out of their online presence, and unfortunately led to a more corporate Web, subject to censorship, data manipulation, and a centralization of the Web. Companies such as Google, Amazon, Facebook (Meta) and Apple (commonly grouped under the acronym GAFA), own a large portion of the web. In parallel to the rise of such businesses and social media platforms at the turn of the new millenium, improvements in Internet speed, wireless connection and hardware miniaturization gave birth to new ways for users to interact with the Web: hand-held multitouch devices such as smartphones and tablets. It is incredible to witness in December 2010 the market share of mobile devices was only 4.1% compared to 95.9% for desktops. At the writing time of this thesis, in September 2023, the mobile market share rose to 53%, more than the desktops. [^stats] This significant change in behavior can also be explained by the rise of dedicated mobile applications released device manufacturers application stores such as Apple's App Store or Google's Play Store. 



Moreoever, further advances in information filtering systems such as recommenders systems changed our online navigation, where suggestions supposedly most pertinent are made to a user – alone or collaboratively – based on past online browsing behaviors. Considering an overwhelming amount of content we face while browsing a platform, recommenders algorithms can prove useful, yet can arises questions as to our online decision-making process: what music we listen to, what date do we meet, what news we read, what item we buy.

Following on the current evolutional aspects of the Web, a new term appears: Web3 or Web 3.0. It is a term used to designate the idea of a decentralized web exploiting blockchain technology, thus claiming to be the successor to Web 2.0, a term used to designate the "social" web with several philosophical objectives: compromising censorship, giving Internet users back control over their data, combating the power of large platforms, reshuffling the cards of ownership on the Internet. Existing technologies are already shaping what will make up this third iteration of the Web: blockchain, artificial intelligence, cloud and edge computing, virtual reality, the Internet of Things (IoT), decentralized apps... Although we noticed Web 2.0 is criticized for its centralization of user data and oligopoly of platforms, the embryonic Web3 as it exists in 2022 is not immune to the centralization and consolidation of these few players into an oligopoly.

The term knowledge refers in the english dictionary to the "fact or condition of knowing something with familiarity gained through experience, learning or association – by study, investigation, observation or experience". Its french translation, under the plural form, "connaissances", appears in 1595 and is described by french writer Montaigne as the "content of knowledge, all that we know.[^montaigne]" Later in the twentieth century, the plural term englobes a more precise meaning of "what we know by study, by research.[^dubos]", closer to the english definition firstly introduced. The singular counterpart "connaissance" however, introduces another layer to how we can also acquire knowledge: practice. "Action or fact to learn something by study and/or practice; result of this action or fact: skills in something, experience of something, knowledge, know-how." This definition makes most sense in a creative practice such as graphic design as expanding knowledge in this field is not only done through reading or examining visual references of past and current graphic works, it is also done by actually practicing graphic design. This implies knowledge behaves in multiple modes, such as intellect, and intuition. Philosophically speaking, another declaration from french philosopher Renan is intriguing: "Knowledge is infinity, versed in a finite mould.[^renan]". In addition, the APA Dictionary states knowledge as a range of one’s understanding or information. In some contexts the words *knowledge* and *memory* are used synonymously.[^apa]

Those two last declarations helps us to introduce how the extent of one's knowledge might be compiled and *remembered*. For someone to makes sense of all that they know, accessible knowledge is acquired by processes of selection, collection and then organisation, in order to be known. By extending one's knowledge, we somehow delimit what we know from what we do not, or have not yet learned, experienced, or practiced. In the common sense, making a collection would mean bringing together elements due to their value, attractiveness, or interestingness. According to the english dictionary, a collection is a "group of similar things that you have deliberately acquired, usually over a period of time." While I agree with evolution over time, and that to collect implies a voluntary decision, I prefer another definition stating collection as "an accumulation of objects gathered for study, comparison, or exhibition or as a hobby." This one embodies a broader sense of collecting as the gathered informations or items can be sometimes quite disparate, while sharing a few common points, or *association*. Coming back to how we defined knowledge in the first place, this is now getting interesting to see that if knowledge can be gained by association, then the act of collection clearly aims towards this end.

As Hans Ulrich Obrist states in his publication *Ways of Curating[^obrist]:*

    

> To make a collection is to find, acquire, organize and store items, whether in a room, a house, a library, a museum or a warehouse. It is also, inevitably, a way of thinking about the world – the connections and principles that produce a collection contain assumptions, juxtapositions, findings, experimental possibilities and associations. Collection-making, you could say, is a method of producing knowledge.



[^obrist]: Hans Ulrich Obrist - Ways of Curating



While Obrist focuses on physical objects relative to a practice of curation, the emphasis on the way of thinking, the connections and associations, are key also to how creatives practices collect, connect by association and grow knowledge over time to develop new skills, crafts or ideas. 



Ursula K. Le Guin in her book *Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction* (1986) brings other perspectives on the notion of collection and gathering, stating the first human tool as a basket, a tool for communion, rather than a spear, a tool for domination. It then places the protagonist in narrative structures as a gatherer rather than a hunter.[^LeGuin] To this aim, Le Guin emphasizes the significance of gathering, collecting, and sharing. This vision supports the idea of a collection working towards collective good, and asks questions about the role of the collector, and also the form of the container gathering such collections. The carrier bag, in this context, becomes a symbol of collection and preservation—a vessel for holding various elements that contribute to the sustenance and enrichment of a community. Le Guin's theory challenges the dominance of the hero's narrative and highlights the importance of collective efforts, cooperation, and the sharing of resources and knowledge.

Following on Le Guin's book, Mindy Seu expands on a contemporary approach. (imagenote: content/images/NewWomansSurvival.webp caption: New Woman's Survival Catalog) (imagenote: content/images/cyberfeminism-index.webp caption: Cyberfeminism Index) In her essay *On Gathering*[^Seu], Seu implies that being a gatherer is an essential human activity, especially in the digital age. She defines the process of gathering to "aggregate, together with collaborators, disparate pieces from an ecosystem, and develop the appropriate container for each collection." Moreover, she explores how digital platforms and online events have transformed the way people gather and share information. Bringing different examples of collective collections, such as the *New Woman's Survival Catalog* and the *Cyberfeminism Index, *Seu explores the evolving nature of gathering, blurring the lines between container and content, and challenging the traditional notions of fixed, solitary authorship.

    

> Gathering stories is radical because it refuses to give the gatherer all of the credit. The collector-collection dynamic is deliberately broken. The person who puts it together is only one of many parts.
