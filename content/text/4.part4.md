# (Digital) Gardening

## A landscape prism of the digital realms

First we will be studying how the vocabulary of nature and landscape seems to be intertwined to approach technique and technology. Envisioning the Web as an ecosystem. Indexing our files on our devices as a forest of branching directories originating from a _root_ folder. Speaking of bugs and viruses or worms about programming errors and potential digital attacks. A Cloud as a fog of data. Surfing on the web, navigating the X (Twitter) stream, downloading torrents of media. Planting seeds and cultivating knowledge in a digital garden. Then we will get insights on the origins of this digital garden neologism and its specificities.

> It's about not trying to use things that are always distracting you and also building that kind of collective knowledge base over time. WhatsApp or Slack, everything gets lost into the stream. You're not actually building anything long term, you're just kind of chatting and it's chaotic, etc.
