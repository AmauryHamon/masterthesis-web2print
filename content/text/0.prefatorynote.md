# Abstract

This thesis delves into the impact of online User-Generated Content (UGC) platforms used to gather (e.g. Are.na) on the practices of interviewed artists, designers and developers. It explores how initial ideas, often cultivated privately, evolve and expand into public sharing. These platforms, acting as personal or communal “digital gardens”, foster "public" growth through collaborative features. The study examines whether these platforms serve as catalysts for creative exploration and production, highlighting the transformative potential to shift individualist processes into models of shared abundance.
