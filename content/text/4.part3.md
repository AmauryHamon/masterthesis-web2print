# The case of Are.na

While the term _Arena_[^arenadef] refers physically to an “enclosed area for public entertainment”, it is also conceptually stated as a “sphere of interest, activity, or competition”, or a “place or situation for controversy”. UGC platforms could be considered as such with data enclosed in silos behind restricted access. In this chapter, we will inquire the case study of a distinctive platform, Are.na, targeting creative research. Full disclosure: I am supporting member of the platform, and actively use it on a daily basis.

## 3.1 Are.na: an indie social networks for creatives (5154)

Are.na is a niche online social network and creative research platform brought by artists, for artists, featuring niche high-quality curated content, founded in 2014 by artists and designers Charles Broskoski, Daniel Pianetti, among others. Private and free to use (for a limited use and functionalities), it is solely financially sustained by its paying members. Are.na stands out from the current market of UGC platforms by offering an ad-free environment, without recommender algorithms and user data collection, allowing its members to exit algorithmic feeds. Are.na states on their website: “We are the only social media company whose only customers are the people who use it.”[^indie]

Described on its landing page as a “more mindful place […] to structure your ideas and build new forms of knowledge together”[^aboutarena], and by its members as a “Social media that doesn't damage your brain”, a “Pinterest for nerds” or “A garden of ideas”,[^describearena], the platform essentially involves in collection-making and curation for creatives, building knowledge individually and/or collectively.  

[^aboutarena]: [https://www.are.na/about](https://www.are.na/about)

[^describearena]: open channel “How do you describe Are.na at a party?” [https://www.are.na/are-na-team/how-do-you-describe-are-na-at-a-party](https://www.are.na/are-na-team/how-do-you-describe-are-na-at-a-party)

Instead of being an all-in-one tool that doesn’t do anything well, Are.na relies on a few key introverted features: connecting **blocks** (images, urls, texts, pdfs, etc.) and **channels** (containers) into other channels – either by uploading, web-clipping (via browser extension), or linking other users’ content. 

Channels can either be private, closed (publicly visible, restricted edit) or open (contributable). Asking for a slightly more cognitive load by design, Are.na emphasizes better contextualization of the content, while omitting extraverted typical social features such as "likes," "favorites," or "shares", hence remaining gentle as Gemma implies:

> Arena is such a polite platform, where people respect each other's little gardens that they're working on. Every now and again, people will add something to an open channel, and it feels like you've had this weird kind of very quiet interaction with another person, which is super nice.

Radically distinctive by its withdrawn minimalist monochromatic design and its default Arial typography, the interface features a calm and distraction-free environment, favoring content over form. 

Main pages such as _Explore (grid-view) _and_ Feed (stack-view)_ feature chronologically ordered blocks pooled from either all users or the ones you follow. The _Profile_ and channel pages lists content in modular views to choose from (channel rows, blocks only, channels only, table, index).

Detail view of a block showcases all the channels it is branched in, along with metadata (source, connected by and date) and secondary features to comment. The minimal UI is exhaustively puzzled out as a _mise en abyme_ by David Reinfurt in an open channel _a-r-e-n-a_.[^reinfurt] According to Daniel, simplicity and reliability is what makes Are.na distinctive:

> You know why I like to use Arena? Because you can take a hundred images and drag them up on the screen. And it works. You need tools that are stupid simple in the sense that they're incredibly reliable.

Reminiscent of hypertext _Project Xanadu_, serendipity and networked thoughts are enhanced thanks to the **bi-directional linking** of blocks & channels. The information architecture is rendered as a **folder structure**, yet underneath the hood it works rather as a **nodal view**. Whether you go single-player or collaborative, blocks and channel are fully interconnected to other members channels, proposing a glimpse into the brain of other creatives.

**Open Source** by default while remaining private, Are.na allows its members to export their data and exit its enclosed silo. Copyright wise, the platform offers source search features, as well as possibility to credit wherever possible original sources in order to further contextualize the content curated by its members. In addition the platform released a free **API**[^api], allowing the creation of custom tools, such as _Hyperchannel_[^hyperchannel], 3D graph channel visualizer, Are.na-to-Print[^printarena], Are.na-to-Slides[^slidearena], etc.,

[^printarena]: [https://print.are.na/](https://print.are.na/)

[^slidearena]: [https://arena2slides.herokuapp.com/](https://arena2slides.herokuapp.com/)

Metrics set the platform as quite a niche compared to bigger mainstream platforms. Currently composed of 27391 monthly active members, 13617 of them are paying members, and the platform generates 1.21 million monthly connections. It’s self-sustainability model currently generates a monthly revenue of $80841, allowing for the maintenance costs, remuneration of the small team in charge of full-time and part-time positions in engineering, product and operations, editorial events and merchandising. This smaller scale factor allows its dedicated members to sense better ownership (through feedback channels, community events and publications).


## 3.2 Use-cases from interviews (3233)

Being an open-ended platform, Are.na does not restrict specific uses to its member. A channel from the _Are.na Commons_ proposes members to add in their use cases. [^howtoarena] The open-endedness of a tool allow for more exploratory and intuitive approaches such as Aurélie’s use of Are.na:

[^howtoarena]: [https://www.are.na/are-na-commons/how-do-you-use-are-na](https://www.are.na/are-na-commons/how-do-you-use-are-na)

> It's pretty hard to know what the real purpose of the people who created these platforms is, I've never looked. There must be instructions for use, I don't know. I've never thought about it. I just intuitively did what was most useful for me. 

> – Aurélie Vial

The interviews drew a diverse range of use cases about interviewees’ gathering methods and creative research purposes. Florian creates private channels to stimulate the birth of a project, while creating public channels on the side for more general moodboards.[^FlorianMood] Most of Baker’s and Gemma are open channels, encouraging other members to contribute elements. Aurélie creates private collaborative channels teamwork moodboards which she can then share with her clients, stating: “I don't just take blocks, part of what I add is images I've taken from sites, from Google, from Pinterest. But I also, scan things from books or other sources and add them to Are.na.” Jonas, uses a lot the browser extension to web-clip content into Are.na “relevant to one of [his] ongoing research channels […] with only two clicks.” As Baker puts it in a broader perspective: \


[^FlorianMood]: [https://www.are.na/florian-hilt/moodboard-57offqyw3oi](https://www.are.na/florian-hilt/moodboard-57offqyw3oi)

> I wouldn't say that I hack Arena, but I would say that I have a fairly conventional use of a tool that's relatively unconventional in the sense that the first time you show it to people, they're are like "what's this thing?" 

Advanced use cases, such as the use of Are.na API were discussed. Baker uses a script to store quotes from his kindle readings into a channel.[^bakerkindle] Gemma publicly showcases her research channels as portfolio value on her website[^gemmaweb], while also using Are.na as hosting for her website media, stating:

[^bakerkindle]: [https://www.are.na/b-wardlaw/bell-hooks-will-to-change](https://www.are.na/b-wardlaw/bell-hooks-will-to-change)

[^gemmaweb]: [https://gemmacope.land/](https://gemmacope.land/)

> There's a whole arena channel of people using arena for websites. I do feel a bit sneaky sometimes because I also use it post all the images on my site and therefore not pay for my own hosting. Thank you. I'm just using your service.

Jonas created an online webdesign gallery connected to one of his channels.[^collected] As Jonas says: “I was collecting inspiring website designs for myself for two years already when I started playing around with the API and built this site. What was originally intended as a fun little experiment has now turned into quite a popular design showcase.” Similarly, Baker Wardlaw and the teaching staff of a visual arts course for architecture students at EPFL (Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne) created an Are.na group[^Artfundaments] for the course gathering of references, publishing students projects, and communication of the course through a website.[^EPFL]

## 3.3 Tension points (4466)

As Charles Broskoski stated in his 2019 conference, “the more you use Are.na the more you get out of it.” [^platformattr] But until when can this become overwhelming or too much?

Frequency of use is one identified tension points drawn from interviews. 

[^platformattr]: [https://videos.theconference.se/charles-broskoski-creating-the](https://videos.theconference.se/charles-broskoski-creating-the)

Depending on who you follow and how many, Frederik draws parallels between Are.na and more mainstream social media feeds: “Are.na is also sometimes the same phenomenon as Instagram, it can be a bit "death scrolling" when you follow too many people. It starts to snowball, and then you lose track a bit.”

Passively scrolling through the content on Are.na without really looking at it, can indeed prevent its members to contextualize what is shown before them as in any other platforms. According to Daniel, “What you need, it's not information but the patience to look through them, and not many people have that.” 

From those interviews three profiles were drawn: from fully private profile, to mixed feelings between sharing and gatekeeping specific channels, and fully displaying publicly or opening to contribution the channels. 

They helped me draw out a tension point on originality and singularity of research compromised by a personal curation process within uniformized collective gatherings of inputs, or social bubbles. 

Frederik argues: “The people I follow on Are.na, apart from certain artists etc., are a lot of people who do the same thing as me. So you end up in a spiral where you also see their references and make them your own.” This echoes to Emilie’s _single-player_ use of Are.na: “I'm going to try to find things in a more organic way, because I have the impression that on these platforms, there are a lot of people reposting and as time goes by, the content becomes very polished and you can't find anything out of the ordinary.” When looking outside of Are.na, in other platform such as Pinterest, Aurélie implies: “you feel that it's a mass thing, and then the images, they come back all the time.” 

While Frederik remain partly open to share on a restrictive basis, some he likes “to keep them public. I have this channel of Swiss logos[^swisslogos] that I find quite funny, it's even open to contribute”. Others private channels where he states the need to review first before showcasing and prioritize in-real-life modes of sharing. 

For Daniel, which tests the quantitative success of a curated channel by waiting to gather sufficient content before it’s become a thing ready to publish: “if that river goes nowhere, it just dissolves. So then what I do with these things is keep them private.” For Jonas, his channels are rarely open for contribution and his “more general research (like inspiring graphic design or useful development resources) is public from the start. Project-specific research often starts private and is sometimes published later.” He also had similar concerns to Frederik, about potential lack of context in the sharing of project-specific research.

The collaboration and contribution to channels is quite disparate from the interviews results. Baker and Gemma on the other hand, are fervent members of the “Go Green” channels, embracing contribution and the social network aspects of Are.na.

> Having the channels open, that was a decision I made a few years ago, in this idea of not trying to gatekeep or say "these things are my own" because at the end of the day, it's a collection of other people's things. So why should I be "Oh, this is mine as the curator."

> – Gemma Copeland

In her gathering process, Gemma states green channels as means of honesty in her research, and she always try to look for existing open channels first before creating her own:

> If I'm working on something and I want to keep the channel private, then it's also an interesting kind of prompt for me to understand why, is it that I'm taking too much reference from these things and perhaps it would be better to make it open and make sure that you're not like secretly being derivative. I feel the public private thing is interesting because it's also about honesty or making sure that you're not ripping people off or getting too influenced by things basically. "Oh, these are my like deep cut, like private references. And like, that's my secret sauce for how I like do cool design."
