## Collecting Knowledge Before the World Wide Web 

(figure: content/images/commonplace-book.jpg caption: Exemple of a commonplace book, mid-17th century)

Before the World Wide Web was born, knowledge was compiled and stored physically in the hands of individuals. Through written and printed books, individuals started their own knowledge management for example with the idea of a commonplace book.

This written "database" serves as a personal compilation of one's individual central storage of knowledge, ideas, quotations, and observations. 


## Rise of the Information Age

How to deal with the accessibility and navigation of ever-increasing information, resistant to nuclear threats?


> The book in itself is curated in an order. It is selected, it's around a topic. You take that for granted, you think that reality is like this. When you go to the internet, that curation doesn't exist. It's a bucket.

> When I was 18, 20, the only way was, design books. I spent an insane amount of money just buying design books. And I remember, spending days and days in the design library, going through books, buying, sharing, with other friends, exchanging books, and that was the place to eat, design, and absorb design.

## From Read-Only to Read-Write: evolution of the World Wide Web

(figure: content/images/timbernerslee.jpg caption: Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989 while working at the CERN. (Image: CERN))

Created in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN, the now commonly called Web was released to the public in 1991, with the underlying motivations to pool resources and help the storing, updating, and finding of information. As stated on the CERN website, the Web was originally conceived and developed to meet the demand for automated information-sharing between scientists in universities and institutes around the world.[^BernersLee1] Using Ted Nelson's Hypertext model, navigating in nonlinear ways through disparate documents with hyperlinks has tremendously helped to build a global collection of knowledge hosted on websites and databases, all accessible on interconnected computers. This key technology of the Information Age, using global networks of computers has grown from a few thousand websites in the early nineties to over 1.5 billion websites today. _Browsing_ the Web – meaning to jump from one webpage to another using hyperlinks – has drawn different ways of interacting with information online: one of them being exploratory surfing. In the nineties, before the Web evolved to its social aspects nowadays, it was initially a more *read-only* approach. Users would then essentially *surf* the web in a passive manner to explore pages without really editing them or appending content. To facilitate access to online information, the rise of search engines such as Google and Yahoo helped users in their search, in addition to more human actions such as bookmarking webpages. In the new millennium arrived what was called Web 2.0 – the social Web. Static websites turned more interactive, making the editing and contributing much easier for people to interact and collaborate with each other. With this in mind, content aggregation platforms such as news and social media (Facebook, X, Instagram, Youtube, Flickr, etc.), forums, blogs, or wikis (more on those later) started to receive content from users and build virtual communities. With those new platforms, users could then connect with friends and family, and share texts, images, and videos as well as opinions on a vast range of topics. To follow up on this file authorization metaphor, the Web essentially became a *read-write* model, which in essence is closer to what Tim Berners-Lee's original vision was:

> A collaborative medium, a place where we [could] all meet and read and write. [^BernersLee]

> When the internet started, it was pretty natural just to use the internet too. But of course, the books were up there. The transition was pretty gradual, I think it took more like 10 years. At some point I started to realize, I haven't bought a book in like 2 years. That is really weird. And I mostly used just the internet for gathering stuff.

Web 2.0 also gave birth to new models of business with the rise of online advertising and e-shops, permitting companies to generate revenues out of their online presence, and unfortunately led to a more corporate Web, subject to censorship, data manipulation, and a centralization of the Web. Companies such as Google, Amazon, Facebook (Meta), and Apple (commonly grouped under the acronym GAFA), own a large portion of the web. In parallel to the rise of such businesses and social media platforms at the turn of the new millennium, improvements in Internet speed, wireless connection, and hardware miniaturization gave birth to new ways for users to interact with the Web: hand-held multitouch devices such as smartphones and tablets. It is incredible to witness that in December 2010 the market share of mobile devices was only 4.1% compared to 95.9% for desktops. At the writing time of this thesis, in September 2023, the mobile market share rose to 53%, more than the desktops.[^stats] This significant change in behavior can also be explained by the rise of dedicated mobile applications released by device manufacturers’ application stores such as Apple's App Store or Google's Play Store.

## After Web 1.0, Web2.0, Web3?

Further advances in information filtering systems such as recommender systems through deep learning algorithms changed our online navigation and access to information, where suggestions supposedly most pertinent are made to a user – alone or collaboratively, pooling other user’s data collection – based on past online browsing behaviors. Considering the overwhelming amount of content we face while browsing a platform, recommender algorithms can prove useful, yet can raise questions as to our online decision-making process: what music we listen to, what date we meet, what news we read, and what item we buy. 

In the recent years, it seems social media reaches a point of fatigue from its audience, which slowly but surely, starts to evacuate the big social media companies, infested with user data collection and targeted ad technologies. This surveillance capitalism of making profit out people's private information, exploiting the psychic weaknesses of users, with the intent of keeping them on its platforms for as long as they can, _doom-scrolling_, raises flags to users, leading to distrust and fear of behavioral manipulation through misinformation from recommended content. Moreover, with so many platforms and services competing for one’s attention through information overload, users also start to look for slower-paced and more conscious Web browsing. This also encourages a shift towards a more post-capital approach, towards the idea of  collaborative commons, where users move from a system of scarcity to one of global abundance in sharing resources. This fostered an emerging typology of more independent social media platforms, between paid communities and/or decentralized alternatives. Meanwhile a comeback to vernacular uses of the web through digital gardening is interesting to study based on this current state of the Web. 

Following on the current evolutional aspects of the Web, a new term appears: _Web3_ or Web 3.0. This term designates the idea of a decentralized web based on blockchain technology, thus claiming to be the successor to Web 2.0, with several philosophical objectives: compromising censorship, giving Internet users back control over their data, combating the power of large platforms, reshuffling the cards of ownership on the Internet. Existing technologies are already shaping what will make up this third iteration of the Web: blockchain, artificial intelligence, cloud and edge computing, virtual reality, the Internet of Things (IoT), decentralized apps... Although we noticed Web 2.0 is criticized for its centralization of user data and oligopoly of platforms, the embryonic Web3 as it exists in 2022 is not immune to the centralization and consolidation of these few players into an oligopoly.
